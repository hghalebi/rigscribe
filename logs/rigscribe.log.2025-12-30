Engineering for Python Code Generation](https://keploy.io/blog/community/prompt-engineering-for-python-code-generation-with-keploy)**\\n\\nPrompt engineering is an essential technique for optimizing AI-generated Python code, ensuring accurate, efficient, and context-aware outputs. As AI-powered tools like OpenAI’s GPT, GitHub Copilot, and Keploy gain popularity in software development, crafting well-structured prompts becomes crucial for generating high-quality Python code. This guide explores the fundamentals of prompt engineering and best practices for AI-driven Python code generation.\\n\\n**[What is Prompt Engineering](https://keploy.io/blog/community/prompt-engineering-for-python-code-generation-with-keploy)?**\\n\\nPrompt engineering involves designing and structuring inputs to guide AI models in producing high-quality responses. In the context of Python code generation, well-crafted prompts ensure the AI understands the intent and delivers precise results. By refining how queries are structured, developers can enhance the quality of AI-generated code, making it more readable, maintainable, and efficient.\\n\\n**Why is Prompt Engineering Important for Python Code Generation?**\\n\\nAI models rely on prompts to generate relevant and accurate code. A poorly structured prompt can lead to ambiguous or incorrect outputs, requiring additional effort to debug and refine. A well-structured prompt reduces ambiguity, improves efficiency, and minimizes the need for extensive post-processing. Prompt engineering is especially crucial for automated test generation tools like Keploy, which leverage AI to create reliable test cases for applications.\\n\\n**Key Strategies for Effective Prompt Engineering**\\n\\nTo generate better Python code with AI, consider the following strategies:\\n\\n**1. Be Specific and Contextual**\\n\\nProviding clear instructions and specifying the expected output format helps AI models generate more accurate results. Instead of asking, \\\"Write a Python function,\\\" a better prompt would be, \\\"Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a sorted list using the quicksort algorithm.\\\"\\n\\n**2. Use Examples to Guide the AI**\\n\\nIncluding input-output examples in your prompt helps AI understand patterns and expectations for code generation. For instance:\\n\\nPrompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.\\n\\nExample Input: 'radar'\\n\\nExample Output: True\\n\\nBy providing examples, AI can better align with the expected behavior.\\n\\n**3. Define Constraints and Requirements**\\n\\nExplicitly stating programming constraints, such as using specific libraries or avoiding certain functions, refines the generated output. If you want to generate a machine learning model using TensorFlow instead of PyTorch, include that in the prompt.\\n\\n**4. Break Down Complex Tasks into Steps**\\n\\nSplitting a large problem into smaller tasks improves AI performance and ensures structured code generation. Instead of asking AI to \\\"build a chatbot,\\\" break it down into \\\"write a Python function to handle user input,\\\" \\\"generate responses using an NLP model,\\\" and \\\"deploy the chatbot using Flask.\\\"\\n\\n**Common Challenges in AI-Generated Python Code**\\n\\nDespite advancements, AI-generated Python code may have challenges such as logical errors, lack of optimization, or missing edge cases. Effective prompt engineering can mitigate these issues by providing clear instructions and expected behavior. Keploy, an AI-powered test case generation tool, can help validate and refine AI-generated code by automating the testing process and identifying potential issues.\\n\\n**Practical Examples of Prompt Engineering for Python Code**\\n\\n**Example 1: Generating a Simple Function**\\n\\nPrompt:\\n\\nWrite a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum value.\\n\\nGenerated Code:\\n\\ndef find_max(numbers):\\n\\nreturn max(numbers)\\n\\n**Example 2: Enforcing Coding Standards**\\n\\nPrompt:\\n\\nWrite a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number, following PEP 8 style guide.\\n\\nGenerated Code:\\n\\ndef factorial(n):\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"Returns the factorial of a given number.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nif n == 0:\\n\\nreturn 1\\n\\nreturn n * factorial(n - 1)\\n\\n**Example 3: Using External Libraries**\\n\\nPrompt:\\n\\nWrite a Python function that uses NumPy to generate a random array of size 10.\\n\\nGenerated Code:\\n\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef random_array():\\n\\nreturn np.random.rand(10)\\n\\n**Tools for Python Code Generation with AI**\\n\\nSeveral AI-powered tools assist in generating Python code efficiently. Some of the notable tools include:\\n\\n- **OpenAI’s GPT** – Generates Python code based on structured prompts.\\n- **GitHub Copilot** – Suggests code snippets within the IDE.\\n- **Keploy** – Automates test case generation and ensures AI-generated code is reliable and functional.\\n\\n\\n**Best Practices for Refining AI-Generated Code**\\n\\n1. **Review and Validate Output** – Always test AI-generated code for correctness and efficiency.\\n2. **Optimize for Readability** – Ensure the generated code follows best practices for maintainability.\\n3. **Use AI for Assistance, Not Replacement** – AI can enhance productivity but should complement human expertise.\\n4. **Leverage Keploy for Test Generation** – AI-generated code should be tested to ensure robustness, and Keploy can automate test creation for better validation.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nPrompt engineering is a powerful skill that enhances AI-driven Python code generation. By crafting precise, structured prompts, developers can improve AI accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in coding tasks. Whether generating new functions, enforcing coding standards, or integrating external libraries, well-designed prompts ensure optimal AI-generated output. Additionally, tools like Keploy help validate and test AI-generated code, ensuring its reliability in real-world applications.\\n\\nMastering prompt engineering not only improves the quality of AI-generated Python code but also enhances overall development efficiency, making AI an invaluable assistant in modern software engineering.\\n\\n========================\\n## Table of contents[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#table-of-contents](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#table-of-contents)\\n\\n- [Be specific with language and requirements](#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n- [Include examples and constraints](#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n- [Break down complex tasks and iterate](#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n- [Avoid common prompting pitfalls](#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n- [Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency](#graphites-Graphite Agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\n\\n[Large language models (LLMs)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/intro-llms) can generate code in many programming languages, but the quality of their output depends heavily on how you prompt them. Crafting a precise prompt can be the difference between hours of debugging and a seamless implementation. The key is to clearly communicate your intent and requirements, because an AI doesn't inherently know your goals – it only follows the patterns described in your prompt. This guide introduces language-agnostic prompt engineering techniques to help both beginners and experienced developers get more accurate and useful code from AI. We'll illustrate each technique with examples of weak vs. improved prompts to show how small changes can yield better results. For a deeper dive into how AI code review works, see our [guide on AI code review](https://graphite.com/guides/ai-code-review).\\n\\n### Be specific with language and requirements[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n\\nThe first rule of prompt engineering for code is to be specific about what you want. Vague prompts yield vague (often incorrect) results. Always mention the programming language, the task or algorithm, and any requirements or constraints. For example, consider asking an AI to generate a sorting algorithm:\\n\\n- **Weak prompt:** \\\"Write a sorting algorithm.\\\"\\n- **Improved prompt:** \\\"Write a **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** implementation of **merge sort** optimized for **memory efficiency**, including **time complexity analysis** and **error handling** for edge cases (e.g. empty arrays).\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe improved prompt is much clearer. It specifies:\\n\\n- The programming language (Python) and specific algorithm (merge sort).\\n- The optimization goal (memory efficiency) and required output details (time complexity analysis).\\n- Error handling expectations and an edge case to consider (empty arrays).\\n\\n\\nBy spelling out these details, you greatly reduce ambiguity. [Microsoft's Developer Tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/) research group observed that prompts with explicit specifications reduced the need for back-and-forth refinements by 68%. In practice, this means the AI is more likely to produce correct, ready-to-use code on the first try.\\n\\nBeing specific also means providing technical context when relevant. If certain constraints matter – such as the target environment, API version, performance or security requirements – include them in the prompt. For instance, specify \\\"Node.js 18 server environment\\\" or \\\"Python 3.10+\\\" if it matters. Otherwise, the model might generate code that is technically correct but not suitable for your situation.\\n> **Tip:** AI code review tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) can help enforce technical requirements and catch missing context.\\n\\n### Include examples and constraints[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n\\nAnother powerful technique is to provide examples or test cases in your prompt. Examples act as implicit constraints, guiding the model toward the format or behavior you expect. For instance, if you want a function with a specific signature or output format, show a snippet of that.\\n\\nImagine you need an email validation function. A weak prompt might just say, \\\"Validate an email address.\\\" An improved prompt would describe requirements and give a usage example, e.g.:\\n> **Prompt:** \\\"Create a TypeScript function `validateEmail(email: string): {isValid: boolean; message: string}` that checks if an email is RFC-5322 compliant and rejects disposable domains. For example, if the input is `\\\"test@tempmail.com\\\"`, it should return an object like `{ isValid: false, message: 'Disposable domain not allowed' }`.\\\"\\n\\nIn this improved version, the prompt lists specific rules (RFC compliance and no disposable domains) and provides a clear function signature and an example of expected output. This gives the AI a template to follow and boundaries to respect. As Dr. Rachel Thomas of fast.ai notes, *\\\"examples in prompts serve as implicit constraints that guide the model toward the desired output format.\\\"* By including a small example or an outline of the output, you help the model understand exactly what you want.\\n\\n### Break down complex tasks and iterate[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n\\nIf your desired output is complex, avoid requesting everything in one huge prompt. It's often better to break down a complex task into smaller steps or use an iterative approach. Large models can handle reasonably detailed prompts, but asking for a full application in one go is likely to produce a convoluted or partial answer. Instead, tackle complex tasks in stages and possibly across multiple prompts:\\n\\n1. **Decompose the problem:** Outline sub-tasks in separate prompts (e.g. first define the data model, then the API endpoints, then the UI components). This ensures each part is handled with focus.\\n2. **Use step-by-step reasoning:** You can actually instruct the model to \\\"think step by step.\\\" For example: \\\"I need a JavaScript function to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Let's solve this step by step: first explain the concept, then choose an algorithm (greedy vs DP), then write the code, then analyze complexity.\\\" By embedding this reasoning process in the prompt, you encourage the AI to work through the problem methodically.\\n3. **Iterate with the AI:** Treat the AI's first output as a draft. Review it, then issue follow-up prompts to refine the code.\\n\\n\\nBy breaking prompts into smaller pieces or sequential turns, you make it easier for the model to comply at each step. You also get opportunities to catch mistakes early and steer the output in the right direction. Remember that you can carry context between prompts (in a chat-based LLM) – use that to your advantage for iterative improvement.\\n\\nFor more information on [integrating AI into your code review workflow](https://graphite.com/guides/integrating-ai-code-review-workflow) and [how to review code written by AI](https://graphite.com/guides/how-to-review-code-written-by-ai), these guides offer practical advice for iterative, AI-assisted development.\\n\\n### Avoid common prompting pitfalls[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n\\nWhile applying the above techniques, watch out for a few common mistakes that can undermine your results:\\n\\n- **Under-specifying the task:** Don't assume the AI \\\"knows\\\" what you intended. If a prompt is too minimal, the model might solve the wrong problem or omit important features. Always double-check that your prompt fully describes the problem.\\n- **Ignoring context or constraints:** Failing to mention the operating environment, framework, or performance/security constraints can result in code that doesn't fit your project needs. Also make sure to include any version requirements or security considerations. Without this, you might get code that technically works but is impractical or unsafe for your use case. The more context you give, the more relevant the output.\\n- **Over-reliance on AI without verification:** Even with good prompts, AI-generated code isn't guaranteed to be perfect. The model might produce subtle logic bugs, use deprecated APIs, or just take an unconventional approach. Never merge AI-written code into production without reviewing it. Treat the AI as a coding assistant, not an infallible coder. Write prompts that encourage best practices (like asking for safe, idiomatic code), and always test and review the output thoroughly. Using linters or static analysis on AI code is also a smart safeguard.\\n> **To compare approaches:** This guide, [Automated vs. manual code reviews: Finding the right balance](https://graphite.com/guides/automated-vs-manual-code-reviews), explores the strengths and limitations of both, and how to combine them for best results.\\n\\nBy avoiding these pitfalls, you ensure that prompt engineering remains a helpful aid rather than a source of technical debt. Prompting is an iterative learning process – over time, you'll learn which clarifications or extra details yield better code from your preferred LLM.\\n\\n### Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\nWriting a good prompt is the first step, but ensuring the quality and consistency of AI-generated code is the next challenge. This is where tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) come in. Graphite Agent is an AI-powered code review assistant that provides immediate, context-aware feedback on code changes – including those written by an AI. It hooks into your development workflow (e.g. reviewing [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)) and flags issues ranging from logic bugs and security vulnerabilities to style violations and missing documentation. Graphite Agent uses your repository's context and even custom rules you define to give relevant suggestions. For example, you can configure Graphite Agent with your project's style guide or common AI mistakes to watch for, and it will catch those patterns in AI-generated code before a human reviewer even sees them.\\n\\n![screenshot of Graphite Agent comment](/images/content/guides/better-prompts-ai-code/sample-Graphite Agent-comment.png)\\n\\nBy incorporating a tool like Graphite Agent in your workflow, you add an extra layer of scrutiny for AI-produced code. It helps ensure the code meets your team's quality standards and is consistent with the rest of your codebase. In practice, Graphite Agent can automatically identify edge cases the AI missed, point out performance issues, and even suggest fixes – all of which saves human reviewers time and instills confidence in using AI-generated code. Remember, prompt engineering and AI coding tools are most effective when paired with robust review practices. [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) bridges that gap by reviewing AI code for you, so you can safely harness AI code generation while maintaining high code quality and consistency.\\n\\n========================\\nYou’ve used [ChatGPT](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python/), and you understand the potential of using a **large language model (LLM)** to assist you in your tasks. Maybe you’re already working on an LLM-supported application and have read about **prompt engineering**, but you’re unsure how to translate the theoretical concepts into a practical example.\\n\\nYour text prompt instructs the LLM’s responses, so tweaking it can get you vastly different output. In this tutorial, you’ll apply multiple **prompt engineering techniques** to a real-world example. You’ll experience prompt engineering as an iterative process, see the effects of applying various techniques, and learn about related concepts from machine learning and data engineering.\\n\\n**In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:**\\n\\n- Work with OpenAI’s **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4** models through their **API**\\n- Apply prompt engineering techniques to a **practical, real-world example**\\n- Use **numbered steps**, **delimiters**, and **few-shot prompting** to improve your results\\n- Understand and use **chain-of-thought prompting** to add more context\\n- Tap into the power of **roles** in messages to go beyond using singular **role prompts**\\n\\n\\nYou’ll work with a **Python script** that you can repurpose to fit your own LLM-assisted task. So if you’d like to use practical examples to discover how you can use prompt engineering to get better results from an LLM, then you’ve found the right tutorial!\\n\\n== **Take the Quiz:**== Test your knowledge with our interactive “Practical Prompt Engineering” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[Prompt Engineering: A Practical Example](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\n**Interactive Quiz**\\n\\n[Practical Prompt Engineering](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\nIn this quiz, you'll test your understanding of prompt engineering techniques with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. You'll revisit how to work with OpenAI's API, apply prompt engineering techniques to practical examples, and use various strategies to improve your results.\\n\\n## Understand the Purpose of Prompt Engineering[](#understand-the-purpose-of-prompt-engineering \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nPrompt engineering is more than a buzzword. You can get vastly different output from an LLM when using different prompts. That may seem obvious when you consider that you get different output when you ask different questions—but it also applies to phrasing the same conceptual question differently. Prompt engineering means constructing your text input to the LLM using specific approaches.\\n\\nYou can think of prompts as arguments and the LLM as the function to which you pass these arguments. Different input means different output:\\n\\nWhile an LLM is much more complex than the toy function above, the fundamental idea holds true. For a successful function call, you’ll need to know exactly which argument will produce the desired output. In the case of an LLM, that argument is text that consists of many different **tokens**, or [pieces of words](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).\\n\\nThe field of prompt engineering is still changing rapidly, and there’s a lot of active research happening in this area. As LLMs continue to evolve, so will the prompting approaches that will help you achieve the best results.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you’ll cover some prompt engineering techniques, along with approaches to iteratively developing prompts, that you can use to get better text completions for your own LLM-assisted projects:\\n\\n- [Zero-Shot Prompting](#describe-your-task)\\n- [Few-Shot Prompting](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output)\\n- [Delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt)\\n- [Numbered Steps](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps)\\n- [Role Prompts](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone)\\n- [Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting)\\n- [Structured Output](#structure-your-output-format-as-json)\\n- [Labeled Conversations](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation)\\n\\n\\nThere are more techniques to uncover, and you’ll also find links to additional resources in the tutorial. Applying the mentioned techniques in a practical example will give you a great starting point for improving your LLM-supported programs. If you’ve never worked with an LLM before, then you may want to peruse [OpenAI’s GPT documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) before diving in, but you should be able to follow along either way.\\n\\n## Get to Know the Practical Prompt Engineering Project[](#get-to-know-the-practical-prompt-engineering-project \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ll explore various prompt engineering techniques in service of a practical example: [sanitizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sanitization) customer chat conversations. By practicing different prompt engineering techniques on a single real-world project, you’ll get a good idea of why you might want to use one technique over another and how you can apply them in practice.\\n\\nImagine that you’re the resident Python developer at a company that handles thousands of customer support chats on a daily basis. Your job is to format and sanitize these conversations. You also help with deciding which of them require additional attention.\\n\\n### Collect Your Tasks[](#collect-your-tasks \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYour big-picture assignment is to help your company stay on top of handling customer chat conversations. The conversations that you work with may look like the one shown below:\\n\\nYou’re supposed to make these text conversations more accessible for further processing by the customer support department in a few different ways:\\n> - Remove personally identifiable information.\\n> - Remove swear words.\\n> - Clean the date-time information to only show the date.\\n\\nThe swear words that you’ll encounter in this tutorial won’t be spicy at all, but you can consider them stand-ins for more explicit phrasing that you might find out in the wild. After sanitizing the chat conversation, you’d expect it to look like this:\\n\\nSure—you could handle it [using Python’s `str.replace()`](https://realpython.com/replace-string-python/) or [show off](https://xkcd.com/208) your [regular expression](https://realpython.com/regex-python/) skills. But there’s more to the task than immediately meets the eye.\\n\\nYour project manager isn’t a technical person, and they stuck another task at the end of this list. They may think of the task as a normal continuation of the previous tasks. But you know that it requires an entirely different approach and technology stack:\\n> Mark the conversations as “positive” or “negative.”\\n\\nThat task lies in the realm of [machine learning](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/machine-learning-python/), namely [text classification](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/), and more specifically [sentiment analysis](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/). Even [advanced regex skills](https://realpython.com/regex-python-part-2/) won’t get you far in this challenge.\\n\\nAdditionally, you know that the customer support team that you’re preparing the data for will want to continue working on it programmatically. Plain text isn’t necessarily the best format for doing that. You want to do work that’s useful for others, so you add yet another stretch goal to your growing list of tasks:\\n> Format the output as JSON.\\n\\nThis task list is quickly growing out of proportion! Fortunately, you’ve got access to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/), and you’ll employ the help of their LLM to solve all of these challenges.\\n\\nOne of the impressive features of LLMs is the breadth of tasks that you can use them for. So you’ll cover a lot of ground and different areas of use. And you’ll learn how to tackle them all with prompt engineering techniques.\\n\\n### Prepare Your Tools[](#prepare-your-tools \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need to know how to [run a Python script](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) from your command-line interface (CLI), and you’ll need an [API key from OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).\\n\\nYou’ll focus on prompt engineering, so you’ll only use the CLI app as a tool to demonstrate the different techniques. However, if you want to understand the code that you’ll be using, then it’ll help to have some experience with [Python classes](https://realpython.com/python-classes/), [defining your own Python functions](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/), [the name-main idiom](https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/), and [using Python to interact with web APIs](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/).\\n\\nTo get started, go ahead and download the example Python script that you’ll work with throughout the tutorial:\\n\\nThe codebase represents a light abstraction layer on top of the OpenAI API and exposes one function called `get_chat_completion()` that’ll be of primary interest for the tutorial. The function interacts with OpenAI’s [`/chat/completions` endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) to generate responses using different models, such as **GPT-3.5-Turbo** and **GPT-4**. You’ll explore both models, starting with GPT-3.5-Turbo, and eventually you’ll move on to the more powerful GPT-4 model.\\n\\nMost of the code in `app.py` revolves around setting up and fetching the settings from `settings.toml`.\\n\\nThe script also parses a command-line argument to allow you to conveniently specify an input file.\\nThe input files that you’ll primarily work with contain [LLM-generated customer support chat conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08082), but feel free to reuse the script and provide your own input text files for additional practice.\\n\\nThe heart of the codebase is `settings.toml`. This [TOML settings file](https://realpython.com/python-toml/) hosts the prompts that you’ll use to sharpen your prompt engineering skills. It contains different prompts formatted in the human-readable settings format TOML.\\n\\nKeeping your prompts in a dedicated settings file can help to put them under [version control](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/), which means you can keep track of different versions of your prompts, which will inevitably change during development.\\n\\nYour Python script will read the prompts from `settings.toml`, assemble them meaningfully, and send an API requests to OpenAI.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can also run all the text prompts directly in the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), which will give you the same functionality as the script. You could even paste the prompts into the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) interface. However, the results will vary because you’ll be interacting with a different model and won’t have the opportunity to change certain settings.\\n\\n### Set Up the Codebase[](#set-up-the-codebase \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nMake sure that you’re on [Python 3.11](https://realpython.com/python311-new-features/) or higher, so that you can [interact with TOML files](https://realpython.com/python311-tomllib/) using the standard library. If you haven’t downloaded the codebase yet, go ahead and click the link below:\\n\\nUnzip the folder and use your CLI to navigate into the folder. You’ll see a handful of files. The most important ones are `app.py` and `settings.toml`:\\n\\n    ./\\n    ├── LICENSE\\n    ├── README.md\\n    ├── app.py\\n    ├── chats.txt\\n    ├── requirements.txt\\n    ├── sanitized-chats.txt\\n    ├── sanitized-testing-chats.txt\\n    ├── settings.toml\\n    ├── settings-final.toml\\n    └── testing-chats.txt\\n\\nThe file `settings.toml` contains placeholders for all the prompts that you’ll use to explore the different prompt engineering techniques. That’s the file that you’ll primarily work with, so open it up. You’ll use it to iteratively develop the prompts for your application.\\n\\nThe file `app.py` contains the Python code that ties the codebase together. You’ll run this script many times throughout the tutorial, and it’ll take care of pulling your prompts from `settings.toml`.\\n\\nAfter you’ve downloaded and unpacked the codebase, create and activate a new [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). Then use [`pip`](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) to install the required dependencies:\\n\\nNote that this tutorial uses `openai` version 1.13.3. OpenAI may introduce breaking changes between API versions, so make sure that you install the pinned dependencies from the requirements file. Then you’ll be able to work through the tutorial without any hiccups.\\n\\nTo run the script successfully, you’ll need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) with which to authenticate your API requests. Make sure to keep that key private and never commit it to version control! If you’re new to using API keys, then read up on [best practices for API key safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).\\n\\nTo integrate your API key with the script and avoid leaking it publicly, you can export the API key as an environment variable:\\n\\nAfter you’ve added your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the script will automatically pick it up during each run.\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve completed the necessary setup steps. You can now run the script using the command line and provide it with a file as additional input text:\\n\\nThe command shown above combines the customer support chat conversations in `chats.txt` with prompts and API call parameters that are saved in `settings.toml`, then sends a request to the OpenAI API. Finally, it prints the resulting text completion to your terminal.\\n\\nFrom now on, you’ll primarily make changes in `settings.toml`. The code in `app.py` is just here for your convenience, and you won’t have to edit that file at all. The changes in the LLM’s output will come from changing the prompts and a few of the API call arguments.\\n\\n### Freeze Responses by Setting the Temperature to Zero[](#freeze-responses-by-setting-the-temperature-to-zero \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nWhen you’re planning to integrate an LLM into a product or a workflow, then you’ll generally want deterministic responses. The same input should give you the same output. Otherwise, it gets hard to provide a consistent service or debug your program if something goes wrong.\\n\\nBecause of this, you’ll want to set the [`temperature` argument](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature) of your API calls to `0`. This value will mean that you’ll get *mostly* deterministic results.\\n\\nLLMs do text completion by predicting the next token based on the probability that it follows the previous tokens. Higher `temperature` settings will introduce more randomness into the results by allowing the LLM to pick tokens with lower probabilities. Because there are so many token selections chained one after one the other, picking one different token can sometimes lead to vastly different results.\\n\\nIf you use the LLM to generate ideas or [alternative implementations](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python/#prompt-chatgpt-for-alternative-implementations) of a programming task, then higher values for `temperature` might be interesting. However, they’re generally undesirable when you build a product.\\n\\nIn the example codebase, you can adjust `temperature` right inside your `settings.toml` file:\\n\\nThe initial value is set at `0`. All the examples in this tutorial assume that you leave `temperature` at `0` so that you’ll get mostly deterministic results. If you want to experiment with how a higher temperature changes the output, then feel free to play with it by changing the value for `temperature` in this settings file.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that you won’t be able to achieve true determinism with the current LLM models offered by OpenAI even if you keep `temperature` at `0`:\\n> An edge-case in GPT-3 with big implications: Inference is non-deterministic (even at temperature=0) when top-2 token probabilities are <1% different. So temperature=0 output is *very close* to deterministic, but actually isn’t. Worth remembering. ([Source](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1608525976702525440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw))\\n\\nSo, while you can’t entirely guarantee that the model will always return the same result, you can get much closer by setting `temperature` to `0`.\\n\\nAnother approach that improves determinism in the results is to set a value for [the `seed` parameter](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter). The provided code sets the seed to `12345`. However, this only has an effect on some of the models.\\n\\n## Start Engineering Your Prompts[](#start-engineering-your-prompts \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nNow that you have an understanding of prompt engineering and the practical project that you’ll be working with, it’s time to dive into some prompt engineering techniques. In this section, you’ll learn how to apply the following techniques to your prompts to get the desired output from the language model:\\n\\n- **Zero-shot prompting:** Giving the language model normal instructions without any additional context\\n- **Few-shot prompting:** Conditioning the model on a few examples to boost its performance\\n- **Using delimiters:** Adding special tokens or phrases to provide structure and instructions to the model\\n- **Detailed, numbered steps:** Breaking down a complex prompt into a series of small, specific steps\\n\\n\\nBy practicing these techniques with the customer chat conversation example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how prompt engineering can enhance the capabilities of language models and improve their usefulness in real-world applications.\\n\\n### Describe Your Task[](#describe-your-task \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ll start your prompt engineering journey with a concept called **zero-shot prompting**, which is just a fancy way of saying that you’re asking a question or describing a task:\\n> Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date, and replace all swear words with “😤”\\n\\nThis task description focuses on the requested steps for sanitizing the customer chat conversation and literally spells them out. This is the prompt that’s currently saved as `instruction_prompt` in the `settings.toml` file:\\n\\nIf you run the Python script and provide the support chat file as an argument, then it’ll send this prompt together with the content of `chats.txt` to OpenAI’s text completion API:\\n\\nIf you correctly installed the dependencies and added your OpenAI API key as an environment variable, then all you need to do is wait until you see the API response pop up in your terminal:\\n\\nIn the example output, you can see that the prompt that you provided didn’t do a good job tackling the tasks. And that’s putting it gently! It picked up that it should do something with the huffing emoji and reduce the [ISO date-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) to only a date. Your results might not have tackled all of that. Overall, nearly all of the work is left undone and the output is useless.\\n\\nIf you’re new to interacting with LLMs, then this may have been a first attempt at outsourcing your development work to the text completion model. But these initial results aren’t exactly exhilarating.\\n\\nSo you’ve described the task in natural language and gotten a bad result. But don’t fret—throughout the tutorial you’ll learn how you can get more useful responses for your task.\\n\\nOne way to do that is by increasing the number of **shots**, or examples, that you give to the model. When you’ve given the model zero shots, the only way to go is up! That’s why you’ll improve your results through **few-shot prompting** in the next section.\\n\\n### Use Few-Shot Prompting to Improve Output[](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nFew-shot prompting is a prompt engineering technique where you provide example tasks and their expected solutions in your prompt. So, instead of just describing the task like you did before, you’ll now add an example of a chat conversation and its sanitized version.\\n\\nOpen up `settings.toml` and change your `instruction_prompt` by adding such an example:\\n\\nOnce you’ve applied the change, give the LLM another chance to sanitize the chat conversations for you by running the script again:\\n\\nYou’ll have to wait for the LLM to predict all the tokens. When it’s done, you’ll see a fresh response pop up in your terminal:\\n\\nOkay, great! This time at least the LLM didn’t eat up all the information that you passed to it without giving anything useful back!\\n\\nThis time, the model tackled some of the tasks. For example, it sanitized the names in square brackets. However, the names of the customers are still visible in the actual conversations. It also didn’t censor the order numbers or the email address.\\n\\nThe model probably didn’t sanitize any of the names in the conversations or the order numbers because the chat that you provided didn’t contain any names or order numbers. In other words, the output that you provided didn’t show an example of redacting names, order numbers, or email addresses in the conversation text.\\n\\nHere you can see how important it is to choose good examples that clearly represent the output that you want.\\n\\nSo far, you’ve provided *one* example in your prompt. To cover more ground, you’ll add another example so that this part of your prompt truly puts the *few* in few-shot prompting:\\n\\nYou added a second example that contains both a customer name as well as an order number in the chat text body. The example of a sanitized chat shows both types of sensitive data replaced with a sequence of asterisks (`****`). Now you’ve given the LLM a good example to *model*.\\n\\nAfter editing `instruction_prompt` in `settings.toml`, run your script again and wait for the response to print to your terminal:\\n\\nWait? Where did most of the output go? You probably expected to see better results, but it looks like you’re getting only two of the conversations back this time!\\n\\nYou’ve added more text to your prompt. At this point, the task instructions probably make up proportionally too few tokens for the model to consider them in a meaningful way. The model lost track of what it was supposed to do with the text that you provided.\\n\\nAdding more examples should make your responses stronger instead of eating them up, so what’s the deal? You can trust that few-shot prompting works—it’s a widely used and very effective prompt engineering technique. To help the model distinguish which part of your prompt contains the instructions that it should follow, you can use *delimiters*.\\n\\n### Use Delimiters to Clearly Mark Sections of Your Prompt[](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you’re working with content that needs specific inputs, or if you provide examples like you did in the previous section, then it can be very helpful to clearly mark specific sections of the prompt. Keep in mind that everything you write arrives to an LLM as a single prompt—a long sequence of tokens.\\n\\nYou can improve the output by using delimiters to fence and label specific parts of your prompt. In fact, if you’ve been running the example code, then you’ve already used delimiters to fence the content that you’re reading from file.\\n\\nThe script adds the delimiters when assembling the prompt in `app.py`:\\n\\nIn line 13, you wrap the chat content in between `>>>>>` and `<<<<<` delimiters. Marking parts of your prompt with delimiters can help the model keep track of which tokens it should consider as a single unit of meaning.\\n\\nYou’ve seen in the previous section that missing delimiters can lead to unexpected results. You might receive less output than expected, like in the previous example, or an empty response. But you might also receive output that’s quite different from what you want! For example, imagine that the chat content that you’re reformatting contains a question at the end, such as:\\n> Can you give me your order number?\\n\\nIf this question is the last line of your prompt without delimiters, then the LLM might continue the imaginary chat conversation by answering the question with an imaginary order number. Give it a try by adding such a sentence to the end of your current prompt!\\n\\nDelimiters can help to separate the content and examples from the task description. They can also make it possible to refer to specific parts of your prompt at a later point in the prompt.\\n\\nA delimiter can be any **sequence of characters** that usually *wouldn’t* appear together, for example:\\n\\n- `>>>>>`\\n- `====`\\n- `####`\\n\\n\\nThe number of characters that you use doesn’t matter too much, as long as you make sure that the sequence is relatively unique. Additionally, you can add labels just before or just after the delimiters:\\n\\n- `START CONTENT>>>>>` content `<<<<<END CONTENT`\\n- `==== START` content `END ====`\\n- `#### START EXAMPLES` examples `#### END EXAMPLES`\\n\\n\\nThe exact formatting also doesn’t matter so much. As long as you mark the sections so that a casual reader could understand where a unit of meaning begins and ends, then you’ve properly applied delimiters.\\n\\nEdit your prompt in `settings.toml` to add a clear reference to your delimited content, and also include a delimiter for the examples that you’ve added:\\n\\nWith these adaptations to your `instruction_prompt`, you now specifically reference the content as `>>>>>CONTENT<<<<<` in your task description. These delimiters match the delimiters that the code in `app.py` adds when assembling the prompt.\\n\\nYou’ve also delimited the examples that you’re providing with `#### START EXAMPLES` and `#### END EXAMPLES`, and you differentiate between the inputs and expected outputs using multiple dashes (`------`) as delimiters.\\n\\nWhile delimiters can help you to get better results, in this case your output is quite similar to before:\\n\\nIt’s noticeable that the model only shows the two example data that you passed as examples. Could it be that your prompt leads to something similar like [overfitting](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/#underfitting-and-overfitting)? Using the actual data that you want to sanitize as your training data is, anyway, not a good idea, so in the next section, you’ll make sure to change that.\\n\\nIn this section, you’ve learned how you can clarify the different parts of your prompt using delimiters. You marked which part of the prompt is the task description and which part contains the customer support chat conversations, as well as the examples of original input and expected sanitized output.\\n\\n### Test Your Prompt Across Different Data[](#test-your-prompt-across-different-data \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nSo far, you’ve created your few-shot examples from the same data that you also run the sanitation on. This means that you’re effectively using your test data to provide context to the model. Mixing training, validation, and testing data is a bad practice in machine learning. You might wonder how well your prompt generalizes to different input.\\n\\nTo test this out, run the script another time with the same prompt using the second file that contains chat conversations, `testing-chats.txt`. The conversations in this file contain different names, and different—soft—swear words:\\n\\nYou’ll keep running your script using `testing-chats.txt` moving forward, unless indicated differently.\\n\\nOnce you’ve waited for the LLM to generate and return the response, you’ll notice that the result isn’t very satisfying:\\n\\nThe model now understands that you meant the examples as examples to follow when applying edits and gives you back all of the new input data. However, it didn’t do a great job following the instructions.\\n\\nThe model didn’t identify new swear words and didn’t replace them. The model also didn’t redact the order numbers, nor did it anonymize the names. It looks like it only managed to reformat your date strings.\\n\\nSo your engineered prompt currently doesn’t work well, and generalizes even worse. If you built a pipeline based on this prompt, where new chats could contain new customer names, then the application would probably continue to perform poorly. How can you fix that?\\n\\nYou’ve grown your prompt significantly by providing more examples, but your task description is still largely just the question that you wrote right at the beginning. To get better results, you’ll need to do some prompt engineering on the task description as well.\\n\\n### Describe Your Request in Numbered Steps[](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you break up your task instructions into a numbered sequence of small steps, then the model is a lot more likely to produce the results that you’re looking for.\\n\\nGo back to your prompt in `settings.toml` and break your initial task description into more granular, specific substeps:\\n\\nWith these step-by-step instructions in place, you’re ready for another run of your script and another inspection of the newly generated output:\\n\\nThat’s a significant improvement! The model managed to follow the pattern of replacing the names in square brackets with `[Agent]` and `[Customer]`, respectively. It correctly identified some new swear words and replaced them with the huffing emoji. The model also redacted the order numbers, and anonymized the names in the conversation texts.\\n\\nOften, one of the best approaches to get better results from an LLM is to make your instructions more specific.\\n\\nFraming your tasks in even smaller and more specific steps, will generally get you better results. Don’t shy away from [some repetition](https://twitter.com/phillip_isola/status/1532189616106881027):\\n\\nIncreasing the specificity of your instructions, and introducing numbered steps, helped you create a well-performing prompt. Your prompt successfully removes personally identifiable information from the conversations, redacts swear words, and reformats the ISO date-time stamp, as well as the usernames.\\n\\nYou could consider your initial task as completed, but there’s more that you want to do, and more prompt engineering techniques to explore. You also know that there are newer models that you could work with, and your success has further piqued your curiosity. It’s time to switch to a different LLM, see how that influences your output, and then continue exploring other techniques.\\n\\n## Perform Chat Completions With GPT-4[](#perform-chat-completions-with-gpt-4 \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ve decided to switch to an even more powerful LLM, GPT-4. In the rest of this tutorial, you’ll use GPT-4 to continue exploring other important prompt engineering techniques:\\n\\n1. **Role prompting**: Using a system message to set the tone of the conversation, and using different roles to give context through labeling\\n2. **Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT)**: Giving the model time to think by prompting it to reason about a task, then including the reasoning in the prompt\\n\\n\\nYou’ll also use GPT-4 to **classify the sentiment** of each chat conversation and structure the output format as **JSON**.\\n\\n### Switch to a Different Model[](#switch-to-a-different-model \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you’re working with the provided script, then all you need to do is pick a chat model from `chat_models` in `settings.toml` and use it as the new value for `model`:\\n\\nChanging these settings will send your request to a different model. Like before, it’ll assemble your prompt in the way necessary for a `/chat/completions` endpoint request, make that request for you, and print the response to your terminal.\\n\\nFor the rest of this tutorial, you’ll work with OpenAI’s latest version of the GPT-4 model. If you don’t have access to this model, then you can instead keep working with the model that you’ve been working with so far.\\n\\nIf you’ve been following along using ChatGPT, then you’re stuck with whatever model currently powers it. Unless you’re a [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) subscriber, then you can [change the model to GPT-4](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7127997-how-can-i-use-gpt-4-in-chatgpt) on the website.\\n\\nWithout changing your prompt, run your script another time to see the different results of the text completion based only on using a different LLM:\\n\\nSome responses may be relatively similar to the ones with the older model. However, you can also expect to receive results like the one shown above, where most swear words are still present.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that developing for a specific model will lead to specific results, and swapping the model may improve or deteriorate the responses that you get. Therefore, swapping to a newer and more powerful model won’t necessarily give you better results straight away.\\n\\nAdditionally, it’s also helpful to keep in mind that API calls to larger models will generally [cost more money per request](https://openai.com/pricing). While it can be fun to always use the latest and greatest LLM, it may be worthwhile to consider whether you really need to upgrade to tackle the task that you’re trying to solve.\\n\\n### Add a Role Prompt to Set the Tone[](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nThere are some additional possibilities when interacting with the API endpoint that you’ve only used implicitly, but haven’t explored yet, such as adding **role labels** to a part of the prompt. In this section, you’ll use the `\\\"system\\\"` role to create a system message, and you’ll revisit the concept later on when you [add more roles](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) to improve the output.\\n\\n**Role prompting** usually refers to adding system messages, which represent information that helps to set the context for upcoming completions that the model will produce. System messages usually aren’t visible to the end user. Keep in mind that the `/chat/completions` endpoint models were initially designed for conversational interactions.\\n\\nYou can also use system messages to set a context for your completion task. You’ll craft a bespoke role prompt in a moment. However, for this specific task, the role prompt is likely less important than it might be for some other tasks. To explore the possible influence of a role prompt, you’ll take a little detour and ask your model to play a role:\\n\\nYou keep `instruction_prompt` the same as you engineered it earlier in the tutorial. Additionally, you now add text to `role_prompt`. The role prompt shown above serves as an example for the impact that a misguided prompt can have on your application.\\n\\nUnleash, thou shall, the parchment’s code and behold the marvels unexpected, as the results may stir wonderment and awe:\\n\\nAs you can see, a role prompt can have quite an impact on the language that the LLM uses to construct the response. This is great if you’re building a conversational agent that should speak in a certain tone or language. And you can also use system messages to keep specific setup information present.\\n\\nFor completion tasks like the one that you’re currently working on, you might, however, not need this type of role prompt. For now, you could give it a common boilerplate phrase, such as *You’re a helpful assistant*.\\n\\nTo practice writing a role prompt—and to see whether you can release your customer chat conversations from the reign of that 16th century villain poet—you’ll craft a more appropriate role prompt:\\n\\nThis role prompt is more appropriate to your use case. You don’t want the model to introduce randomness or to change any of the language that’s used in the conversations. Instead, you just want it to execute the tasks that you describe. Run the script another time and take a look at the results:\\n\\nThat looks much better again! Abide concealed in yonder bygone era, ye villainous poet!\\n\\nAs you can see from these examples, role prompts can be a powerful way to change your output. Especially if you’re using the LLM to build a conversational interface, then they’re a force to consider.\\n\\nFor some reason, GPT-4 seems to consistently pick `[Client]` over `[Customer]`, even though you’re specifying `[Customer]` in the few-shot examples. You’ll eventually get rid of these verbose names, so it doesn’t matter for your use case.\\n\\nHowever, if you’re determined and curious—and manage to prompt `[Client]` away—then share the prompt that worked for you in the comments.\\n\\nIn the final section of this tutorial, you’ll revisit using roles and see how you can employ [the power of conversation](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) to improve your output even in a non-conversational completion task like the one you’re working on.\\n\\n### Classify the Sentiment of Chat Conversations[](#classify-the-sentiment-of-chat-conversations \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve engineered a decent prompt that seems to perform quite well in sanitizing and reformatting the provided customer chat conversations. To fully grasp the power of LLM-assisted workflows, you’ll next tackle the tacked-on request by your manager to also classify the conversations as positive or negative.\\n\\nStart by saving both sanitized conversation files into new files that will constitute the new inputs for your sentiment classification task:\\n\\nYou could continue to build on top of the previous prompt, but eventually you’ll hit a wall when you’re asking the model to do too many edits at once. The classification step is conceptually distinct from the text sanitation, so it’s a good cut-off point to start a new pipeline.\\n\\nThe sanitized chat conversation files are also included in the example codebase:\\n\\nAgain, you want the model to do the work for you. All you need to do is craft a prompt that spells out the task at hand, and provide examples. You can also edit the role prompt to set the context for this new task that the model should perform:\\n\\nYou can now run the script and provide it with the sanitized conversations in `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` that were the output of your previously engineered prompt:\\n\\nYou added another step to your task description and slightly modified the few-shot examples in your prompt. Not a lot of extra work for a task that would have required a lot more work without the help of an LLM. But is this really sufficient? Take a look at the output once your script has finished running:\\n\\nThe output is quite promising! The model correctly labeled conversations with angry customers with the fire emoji. However, the first conversation probably doesn’t entirely fit into the same bucket as the rest because the customer doesn’t display a negative sentiment towards the company.\\n\\nAssume that all of these conversations were resolved positively by the customer service agents and that your company just wants to follow up with those customers who seemed noticeably angry with their situation. In that case, you might need to tweak your prompt a bit more to get the desired result.\\n\\nYou could [add more examples](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output), which is generally a good idea because it creates more context for the model to apply. Writing a [more detailed description](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps) of your task helps as well, as you’ve seen before. However, to tackle this task, you’ll learn about another useful prompt engineering technique called *chain-of-thought* prompting.\\n\\n### Walk the Model Through Chain-of-Thought Prompting[](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nA widely successful prompt engineering approach can be summed up with the [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) of *giving the model time to think*. You can do this with a couple of different specific techniques. Essentially, it means that you prompt the LLM to produce intermediate results that become additional inputs. That way, the reasoning doesn’t need to take distant leaps but only hop from one lily pad to the next.\\n\\nOne of these approaches is to use **chain-of-thought (CoT)** prompting techniques. To apply CoT, you prompt the model to generate intermediate results that then become part of the prompt in a second request. The increased context makes it more likely that the model will arrive at a useful output.\\n\\nThe smallest form of CoT prompting is **zero-shot CoT**, where you literally ask the model to *think step by step*. This approach yields [impressive results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) for mathematical tasks that LLMs otherwise often solve incorrectly.\\n\\nChain-of-thought operations are technically split into two stages:\\n\\n1. **Reasoning extraction**, where the model generates the increased context\\n2. **Answer extraction**, where the model uses the increased context to generate the answer\\n\\n\\nReasoning extraction is useful across a variety of CoT contexts. You can generate few-shot examples from input, which you can then use for a separate step of extracting answers using more detailed chain-of-thought prompting.\\n\\nYou can try zero-shot CoT on the sanitized chat conversations to embellish the few-shot examples that you’ll use to classify the chat conversations more robustly. Remove the examples and replace the instructions describing the reasoning on how you would classify the conversations in more detail:\\n\\nYou spelled out the criteria that you want the model to use to assess and classify sentiment. Then you add the sentence *Let’s think step by step* to the end of your prompt.\\n\\nYou want to use this zero-shot CoT approach to generate few-shot examples that you’ll then build into your final prompt. Therefore, you should run the script using the data in `sanitized-chats.txt` this time:\\n\\nYou’ll get back a reference to the conversations, with the reasoning spelled out step by step to reach the final conclusion:\\n\\nThe reasoning is straightforward and sticks to your instructions. If the instructions accurately represent the criteria for marking a conversation as positive or negative, then you’ve got a good playbook at hand.\\n\\nYou can now use this information to improve the few-shot examples for your sentiment classification task:\\n\\nYou’re using the same examples as previously, but you’ve enhanced each of the examples with a short chain of thought that you generated in the previous call. Give your script another spin using `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` as the input file and see whether the results have improved:\\n\\nGreat! Now the first conversation, which was initially classified as negative, has also received the green checkmark.\\n\\nIn this section, you’ve supported your examples with reasoning for why a conversation should be labeled as positive vs negative. You generated this reasoning with another call to the LLM.\\n\\nAt this point, it seems that your prompt generalizes well to the available data and classifies the conversations as intended. And you only needed to carefully craft your words to make it happen!\\n\\n### Structure Your Output Format as JSON[](#structure-your-output-format-as-json \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nAs a final showcase for effective prompting when incorporating an LLM into your workflow, you’ll tackle the last task, which you added to the list youself: to pass the data on in a structured format that’ll make it straightforward for the customer support team to process further.\\n\\nYou already specified a format to follow in the previous prompt, and the LLM returned what you asked for. So it might just be a matter of asking for a different, more structured format, for example [JSON](https://realpython.com/python-json/):\\n\\nIn your updated `instruction_prompt`, you’ve explicitly asked the model to return the output as valid JSON. Then, you also adapted your few-shot examples to represent the JSON output that you want to receive. Note that you also applied additional formatting by removing the date from each line of conversation and truncating the `[Agent]` and `[Customer]` labels to single letters, `A` and `C`.\\n\\nYou’re still using example chat conversations from your sanitized chat data in `sanitized-chats.txt`, and you send the sanitized testing data from `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` to the model for processing.\\n\\nIn this case, you receive valid JSON, as requested. The classification still works as before and the output censors personally identifiable information, replaces swear words, and applies all the additional requested formatting:\\n\\nYour output may be different and show some small hiccups, but overall, this output is quite impressive and useful! You could pass this JSON structure over to the customer support team, and they could quickly integrate it into their workflow to follow up with customers who displayed a negative sentiment in the chat conversation.\\n\\nYou could stop here, but the engineer in you isn’t quite satisfied yet. All the instructions just in a single prompt? Your premonition calls and tells you tales about maintainability. In the next section, you’ll refactor your prompts to apply role labels before you set up your LLM-assisted pipeline and call it a day.\\n\\n### Improve Your Output With the Power of Conversation[](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou added a [role prompt](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone) earlier on, but otherwise you haven’t tapped into the power of *conversations* yet.\\n\\nIn this final section, you’ll learn how you can provide additional context to the model by splitting your prompt into multiple separate messages with different labels.\\n\\nIn calls to the `/chat/completions` endpoint, a prompt is split into several **messages**. Each message has its content, which represents the prompt text. Additionally, it also has a **role**. There are [different roles](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-role) that a message can have, and you’ll work with three of them:\\n\\n1. `\\\"system\\\"` gives context for the conversation and helps to set the overall tone.\\n2. `\\\"user\\\"` represents the input that a user of your application might provide.\\n3. `\\\"assistant\\\"` represents the output that the model would reply with.\\n\\n\\nSo far, you’ve provided context for different parts of your prompt all mashed together in a single prompt, more or less well separated [using delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt). When you use a model that’s optimized for chat, such as GPT-4, then you can use roles to let the LLM know what type of message you’re sending.\\n\\nFor example, you can create some variables for your few-shot examples and separate variables for the associated CoT reasoning and outputs:\\n\\nYou’ve disassembled your `instruction_prompt` into seven separate prompts, based on what role the messages have in your conversation with the LLM.\\n\\nThe helper function that builds a messages payload, `_assemble_chat_messages()`, is already set up to include all of these prompts in the API request. Take a look into `app.py` to check out the separate messages, with their fitting roles, that make up your overall prompt:\\n\\nYour prompt is now split into distinct parts, each of which has a certain role label:\\n\\n- **Example input** has the `\\\"user\\\"` role.\\n- **Reasoning** that the model created has the `\\\"system\\\"` role.\\n- **Example output** has the `\\\"assistant\\\"` role.\\n\\n\\nYou’re now providing context for how user input might look, how the model can reason about classifying the input, and how your expected output should look. You removed the delimiters that you previously used for labeling the example sections. They aren’t necessary now that you’re providing context for the parts of your prompt through separate messages.\\n\\nGive your script a final run to see whether the power of conversation has managed to improve the output:\\n\\nThis JSON structure is looking legitimately great! The formatting that you wanted now shows up throughout, and the conversations are labeled correctly.\\n\\nAdditionally, you’ve improved the maintainability of your prompts by splitting them into separate labels. You can feel proud to pass on such a useful edit of the customer chat conversation data to your coworkers!\\n\\n## FAQs[](#faqs \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ve covered common prompt engineering techniques, and here, you’ll find a few questions and answers that sum up the most important concepts that you’ve covered in this tutorial.\\n\\nYou can use these questions to check your understanding or to recap and solidify what you’ve just learned. After each question, you’ll find a brief explanation hidden in a collapsible section. Click the *Show/Hide* toggle to reveal the answer. Time to dive in!\\n\\nKnowledge about prompt engineering is crucial when you work with large language models (LLMs) because you can receive [much better results](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps) with carefully crafted prompts.\\n\\nThe `temperature` setting controls the [amount of randomness](#freeze-responses-by-setting-the-temperature-to-zero) in your output. Setting the `temperature` argument of API calls to `0` will increase consistency in the responses from the LLM. Note that OpenAI’s LLMs are only ever *mostly* deterministic, even with the temperature set to `0`.\\n\\n[Few-shot prompting](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output) is a common prompt engineering technique where you add examples of expected input and desired output to your prompt.\\n\\n[Using delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt) can be helpful when dealing with more complex prompts. Delimiters help to separate and label sections of the prompt, assisting the LLM in understanding its tasks better.\\n\\n[Testing your prompt](#test-your-prompt-across-different-data) with data that’s separate from the training data is important to see how well the model generalizes to new conditions.\\n\\nYes, generally adding more context will lead to more accurate results. However, it’s also important *how* you add the additional context. [Just adding more text](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output) may lead to worse results.\\n\\n[Role prompting](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone) means providing a system message that sets the tone or context for a conversation. This can greatly impact how the model constructs the response. You can also [use roles to provide context labels](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) for parts of your prompt.\\n\\nIn [chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting), you prompt the LLM to produce intermediate reasoning steps. You can then include these steps in the answer extraction step to receive better results.\\n\\n## Next Steps[](#next-steps \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you’ve learned about various prompt engineering techniques, and you’ve built an LLM-assisted Python application along the way. If you’d like to learn more about prompt engineering, then check out some related questions, as well as some resources for further study below:\\n\\nYes, prompt engineer can be a real job, especially in the context of AI and machine learning. As a prompt engineer, you design and optimize prompts so that AI models like GPT-4 produce desired responses. However, it might not be a stand-alone job title everywhere. It could be a part of broader roles like [machine learning](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/machine-learning-python/) engineer or [data scientist](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/data-science-python-core-skills/).\\n\\nPrompt engineering, like any other technical skill, requires time, effort, and practice to learn. It’s not necessarily easy, but it’s certainly possible for someone with the right mindset and resources to learn it. If you’ve enjoyed the iterative and text-based approach that you learned about [in this tutorial](#understand-the-purpose-of-prompt-engineering), then prompt engineering might be a good fit for you.\\n\\nThe field of prompt engineering is quite new, and LLMs keep developing quickly as well. The landscape, best practices, and most effective approaches are therefore changing rapidly. To continue learning about prompt engineering using free and open-source resources, you can check out [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro/) and the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/).\\n\\nHave you found any interesting ways to incorporate an LLM into your workflow? Share your thoughts and experiences in the comments below.\\n\\n== **Take the Quiz:**== Test your knowledge with our interactive “Practical Prompt Engineering” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[Prompt Engineering: A Practical Example](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\n**Interactive Quiz**\\n\\n[Practical Prompt Engineering](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\nIn this quiz, you'll test your understanding of prompt engineering techniques with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. You'll revisit how to work with OpenAI's API, apply prompt engineering techniques to practical examples, and use various strategies to improve your results.\\n\\n========================\\nLLMs like ChatGPT are very effective at code generation. In this section, we will cover many examples of how to use ChatGPT for code generation.\\n\\nThe OpenAI's Playground (Chat Mode) and the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model are used for all examples below.\\n\\nAs with all chat models from OpenAI, you can use a `System Message` to define the behavior and format of the responses. We will use the following System Message for the prompt examples:\\n\\n## Basic Example[](#basic-example)\\n\\nThe `User Message` will then be the prompt itself with the instruction of the specific code you want the model to generate. Below is a snapshot of the first basic prompt for code generation. Note that the final code was generated by the `Assistant`.\\n\\n![CODE1](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchat-mode.3928920f.png&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nHere is the prompt if you want to try it yourself:\\n\\n## Turn Comments Into Code[](#turn-comments-into-code)\\n\\nYou can also use the code generation capabilities of these LLMs to generate code from comments alone. Let's look at another example that passes the instructions as a comment block:\\n\\n*Prompt:*\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\nThe generated code looks like working code. However, the output doesn't contain an important `import` statement, i.e., `import json`. While these models generate working code, you must pay close attention to small details like this and always make sure to test your code.\\n\\n## Complete Functions or Next Line[](#complete-functions-or-next-line)\\n\\nThese LLMs have also been incorporated into tools like GitHub Copilot which makes them useful for developers. One useful feature is the ability of the model to complete functions.\\n\\n*Prompt:*\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\n## MySQL Query Generation[](#mysql-query-generation)\\n\\nBesides the basic code generation example above, you can use the model to generate useful code that could be used in other aspects of programming like creating and testing MySQL queries.\\n\\nLet's say you have a dataset with some information which you can include as part of the prompt and then instruct it to generate a specific query. For example:\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\nThe model generates a query! However, in this example we made up the database so we don't have a database to test the generated query. If you are testing this example, it could be useful to have this database created. Fortunately, you can use ChatGPT to generate this for you as well. One approach is using a modified version of the prompt above with slightly different instructions to generate a database schema:\\n\\nThe model generated the following schema:\\n\\nYou can create a temporary database using something like [sqliteonline.com (opens in a new tab)](https://sqliteonline.com/).\\n\\nYou will also need dummy data to test if the original generated query was valid. Let's use ChatGPT for this too! The prompt could look something like the following:\\n\\nThe output with the insert statements:\\n\\nNow that you have the database and the dummy data, you can test the original query. Based on the dummy data, the result should be two rows with `Jane Doe` and `John Doe`.\\n\\n## Explain Code[](#explain-code)\\n\\nIf you are learning to program in a certain language, it might be useful to prompt the model to explain certain bits of code. Let's reuse the query generated above and ask the model to explain it.\\n\\nIf you are using the same System Message from before, be careful of how you are instructing the model. For example, if we use the following example, the model will complain that it is a code assistant in Python but it still provides an explanation. Sometimes the model refuses to generate what you are instructing because it's designed to follow the System Message.\\n\\n*Prompt:*\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\n## Editing Code[](#editing-code)\\n\\nExample coming soon!\\n\\n## Debugging Code[](#debugging-code)\\n\\nExample coming soon!\\n\\n## Best practices[](#best-practices)\\n\\nComing soon!\\n\\n[![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQgMjQiIHN0cm9rZT0iY3VycmVudENvbG9yIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIj48cGF0aCBzdHJva2UtbGluZWNhcD0icm91bmQiIGQ9Ik05IDVsNyA3LTcgNyIgc3Ryb2tlLXdpZHRoPSIyIiBzdHJva2UtbGluZWpvaW49InJvdW5kIiAvPjwvc3ZnPg==)Tackling Generated Datasets Diversity](/applications/generating_textbooks \\\"Tackling Generated Datasets Diversity\\\")[Graduate Job Classification Case Study![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQgMjQiIGZpbGw9Im5vbmUiIHN0cm9rZT0iY3VycmVudENvbG9yIj48cGF0aCBkPSJNOSA1bDcgNy03IDciIHN0cm9rZS13aWR0aD0iMiIgc3Ryb2tlLWxpbmVqb2luPSJyb3VuZCIgc3Ryb2tlLWxpbmVjYXA9InJvdW5kIiAvPjwvc3ZnPg==)](/applications/workplace_casestudy \\\"Graduate Job Classification Case Study\\\")\\n\\n========================\\n## Select your cookie preferences\\n\\nWe use essential cookies and similar tools that are necessary to provide our site and services.

The payment service is down, and the AI-generated script that was supposed to handle failovers isn't working. The code looked perfect in development. It passed all the tests. But now it's failing because it hardcoded an API key, doesn't handle AWS credential rotation, and has no audit logging for compliance.\\n\\nThis happens more than anyone wants to admit. [Industry research](https://itrevolution.com/articles/new-research-reveals-ai-coding-assistants-boost-developer-productivity-by-26-what-it-leaders-need-to-know/) shows AI coding assistants boost developer productivity by 26%. But here's the problem: [45% of AI-generated code](https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/) contains security vulnerabilities. Most companies are getting faster at building broken software.\\n\\nThe real issue isn't with AI itself. It's that everyone's using the wrong prompts.\\n\\nThink about how most developers use AI coding tools. They type something like \\\"write a Python script to process payments\\\" and expect magic. What they get is code that works in a demo but falls apart in production. It's like asking someone to build you a car and being surprised when they hand you a go-kart.\\n\\nEnterprise software is different. It needs to handle authentication, logging, error recovery, compliance, and integration with systems that were built when Python was still a snake. Most AI prompts don't even mention these requirements.\\n\\nHere's what's counterintuitive: the solution isn't better AI models. It's better prompts. The difference between a prompt that generates toy code and one that generates production-ready code isn't the AI. It's the human who wrote the prompt.\\n\\nEvery large company has the same problem. Developers generate code fast, but it doesn't work in production. The AI creates beautiful functions that assume perfect network conditions, unlimited memory, and no security requirements.\\n\\nReal enterprise code is mostly error handling and edge cases. It's checking if services are down, rotating credentials, masking sensitive data, and logging everything for audits. A payment processing function in a real company spends more time dealing with failures than processing payments.\\n\\nBut look at typical AI prompts. They're all happy path scenarios. \\\"Write a function to connect to a database\\\" never mentions connection pooling, credential rotation, or what happens when the database is unavailable. The AI generates code that works once and breaks forever.\\n\\nThis creates a weird dynamic. Developers feel productive because they're writing code fast. Managers see features shipping quickly. But operations teams know the truth. They're the ones getting called at night when the pretty AI-generated code encounters its first real-world problem.\\n\\nThe gap between development speed and production reliability is growing. Companies are shipping faster than ever while their systems become more fragile. It's like building houses with cardboard because it's quicker than using wood.\\n\\n## **The Context Problem Nobody Talks About**\\n\\nHere's something most people don't understand about AI coding tools. The quality of generated code isn't just about the model. It's about how much context the AI can see.\\n\\nMost AI coding assistants have tiny context windows. They can see maybe a few files at once. But enterprise software isn't a collection of independent files. It's a web of dependencies, shared libraries, configuration systems, and integration patterns that span hundreds of services.\\n\\nWhen an AI can only see a single file, it makes assumptions. It assumes hardcoded values are fine. It assumes simple error handling is enough. It assumes the function will run in isolation. These assumptions kill production systems.\\n\\nThink about it this way. If you asked a new developer to write code without showing them the existing codebase, architecture documentation, or integration patterns, what would you expect? That's essentially what most AI tools are doing.\\n\\n[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) has a 200k token context window. That's 12 times larger than most competitors. It can see entire codebases, understand existing patterns, and generate code that actually fits into real systems. It's like the difference between building a bridge with a blueprint versus guessing what the other side looks like.\\n\\nContext isn't just nice to have. It's the difference between code that works and code that integrates.\\n\\nLet's look at how to write prompts that actually work. The secret is specificity. Don't ask for a payment processor. Ask for a payment processor that handles PCI compliance, retry logic, fraud detection, audit logging, and integration with your existing authentication system.\\n\\nHere's a prompt that generates real enterprise code:\\n\\nNotice what's different? It specifies the Python version, the exact cloud services, the validation library, the encryption method, the monitoring system, and the testing framework. It asks for retry logic and edge case handling. This isn't a toy prompt. It's a specification.\\n\\nThe AI knows to include AWS credential handling because S3 and Redshift are mentioned. It knows to add error logging because CloudWatch metrics are required. It generates proper exception handling because edge cases are explicitly mentioned.\\n\\nCompare that to \\\"write a script to process CSV files.\\\" The AI would generate something that works on your laptop but fails in production. No error handling, no monitoring, no security, no tests.\\n\\nHere's another example for authentication:\\n\\nThis prompt gets enterprise-grade authentication code because it mentions the specific requirements that matter: hierarchical roles, LDAP integration, audit logging, and performance testing. The AI generates code that actually works in a real company.\\n\\nThe pattern is simple. Specify everything that matters for production: security, monitoring, error handling, testing, and integration requirements.\\n\\nLet's go through prompts that generate production-ready code. Each one includes the enterprise requirements that most prompts ignore.\\n\\n**Secure ETL Pipeline with Compliance Monitoring**\\n\\nThis works because it specifies the complete data pipeline with security and monitoring. The AI generates code that handles AWS credentials, encryption keys, network failures, and malformed data. It's not just an ETL script. It's an enterprise ETL system.\\n\\n**SOC 2 Audit Log Decorator Framework**\\n\\nCompliance isn't optional in enterprise software. This prompt generates a logging system that meets audit requirements. The AI includes sensitive data masking, correlation IDs, and proper error handling because the prompt mentions SOC 2 compliance.\\n\\n**Role-Based Access Control with Enterprise Integration**\\n\\nAuthentication in enterprise software is complex. This prompt generates code that integrates with existing directory services and handles the permission hierarchies that real companies need. It's not a toy login system. It's enterprise identity management.\\n\\n**Zero-Downtime Kubernetes Deployment Orchestrator**\\n\\nDeployment automation needs to be bulletproof. This prompt generates code that handles the complexity of Kubernetes deployments, including rollback logic and notification systems. It's production deployment automation that actually works.\\n\\n**PII Detection and GDPR Compliance Processor**\\n\\nPrivacy regulations aren't going away. This prompt generates code that handles the complexity of data privacy, including detection algorithms, masking strategies, and audit trails. It's not just data processing. It's compliant data processing.\\n\\n**Multi-Tenant Logging with Data Isolation**\\n\\nMulti-tenant systems need perfect data isolation. This prompt generates logging infrastructure that prevents data leakage between tenants while maintaining operational visibility. It's enterprise logging that actually works.\\n\\n**Automated Compliance Monitoring Framework**\\n\\nCompliance monitoring can't be manual. This prompt generates automation that continuously validates security controls and generates the reports that auditors need. It's compliance automation that reduces audit overhead.\\n\\n**High-Performance Async API Client Generator**\\n\\nAPI integration in enterprise systems needs to handle failures gracefully. This prompt generates clients with proper connection management, retry logic, and error handling. It's not just an API wrapper. It's resilient integration infrastructure.\\n\\nNotice what all these prompts have in common? They specify the production requirements that toy prompts ignore.\\n\\nEvery prompt mentions specific technologies, not generic concepts. Instead of \\\"database,\\\" they say \\\"Redshift.\\\" Instead of \\\"logging,\\\" they say \\\"CloudWatch Logs.\\\" Instead of \\\"security,\\\" they say \\\"JWT tokens with LDAP integration.\\\"\\n\\nEvery prompt includes error handling and monitoring. Real systems fail, and production code needs to handle failures gracefully. These prompts generate code that assumes failures will happen.\\n\\nEvery prompt mentions testing and validation. Enterprise code without tests is just technical debt waiting to happen. These prompts generate the test coverage that production systems need.\\n\\nEvery prompt includes compliance and security requirements. Enterprise software operates under regulatory constraints that toy examples ignore. These prompts generate code that meets real compliance requirements.\\n\\nThe difference isn't the AI model. It's the specificity of the request.\\n\\nHere's what happens when companies use generic AI prompts. Developers generate code fast, but it creates more problems than it solves.\\n\\nThe code works in development but fails in production. The failure modes are predictable: hardcoded credentials, missing error handling, no audit logging, and poor integration with existing systems. Operations teams spend their time fixing AI-generated code instead of building new features.\\n\\nSecurity teams find vulnerabilities in every release. The AI-generated code doesn't follow security best practices because the prompts don't mention security requirements. Every deployment becomes a security review instead of a routine release.\\n\\nCompliance teams can't audit the systems because the code doesn't generate the logs and reports they need. Simple features become compliance projects because the foundation is wrong.\\n\\nThe productivity gains from AI disappear under the weight of technical debt. Teams move fast initially but slow down as the codebase becomes unmaintainable. It's like driving fast with bad brakes. You go faster until you crash.\\n\\nThe solution isn't avoiding AI. It's using it correctly. Good prompts generate code that integrates with existing systems, follows security best practices, and meets compliance requirements.\\n\\nThink about AI as a very fast junior developer who knows syntax but doesn't understand context. You wouldn't tell a junior developer to \\\"build a payment system\\\" without explaining the requirements, architecture, and constraints. Don't do it with AI either.\\n\\nSpecify everything that matters for production. Mention the exact technologies, security requirements, error handling needs, and integration patterns. The more specific the prompt, the better the generated code.\\n\\nReview everything before deployment. AI-generated code still needs human oversight. Look for security issues, integration problems, and missing error handling. Use the generated code as a starting point, not a finished product.\\n\\nTest comprehensively. AI generates code that passes happy path tests but fails under stress. Test error conditions, security scenarios, and integration edge cases. Production testing reveals problems that development testing misses.\\n\\nMonitor everything in production. AI-generated code fails in unexpected ways. Good monitoring catches problems before they impact users. Plan for failures because they will happen.\\n\\nThe companies that get AI right will build software faster without sacrificing quality. They'll use specific prompts that generate production-ready code instead of toy examples.\\n\\nThe companies that get AI wrong will build technical debt faster than ever. They'll ship broken software quickly and spend years fixing it. The productivity gains will disappear under maintenance overhead.\\n\\nThe difference isn't the AI technology. Every company has access to the same models. The difference is prompt engineering and code review discipline.\\n\\n[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) provides the enterprise capabilities that make this possible: 200k token context windows, SOC 2 Type II certification, and Claude Sonnet 4 integration. But the tool is only as good as the prompts you give it.\\n\\nThe future belongs to companies that understand this distinction. AI is a powerful tool for generating code, but only if you know how to ask for what you actually need.\\n\\nWant to see the difference that enterprise-grade AI coding capabilities make?

You'll revisit how to work with OpenAI's API, apply prompt engineering techniques to practical examples, and use various strategies to improve your results.\\n\\n## Understand the Purpose of Prompt Engineering[](#understand-the-purpose-of-prompt-engineering \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nPrompt engineering is more than a buzzword. You can get vastly different output from an LLM when using different prompts. That may seem obvious when you consider that you get different output when you ask different questions—but it also applies to phrasing the same conceptual question differently. Prompt engineering means constructing your text input to the LLM using specific approaches.\\n\\nYou can think of prompts as arguments and the LLM as the function to which you pass these arguments. Different input means different output:\\n\\nWhile an LLM is much more complex than the toy function above, the fundamental idea holds true. For a successful function call, you’ll need to know exactly which argument will produce the desired output. In the case of an LLM, that argument is text that consists of many different **tokens**, or [pieces of words](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).\\n\\nThe field of prompt engineering is still changing rapidly, and there’s a lot of active research happening in this area. As LLMs continue to evolve, so will the prompting approaches that will help you achieve the best results.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you’ll cover some prompt engineering techniques, along with approaches to iteratively developing prompts, that you can use to get better text completions for your own LLM-assisted projects:\\n\\n- [Zero-Shot Prompting](#describe-your-task)\\n- [Few-Shot Prompting](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output)\\n- [Delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt)\\n- [Numbered Steps](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps)\\n- [Role Prompts](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone)\\n- [Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting)\\n- [Structured Output](#structure-your-output-format-as-json)\\n- [Labeled Conversations](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation)\\n\\n\\nThere are more techniques to uncover, and you’ll also find links to additional resources in the tutorial. Applying the mentioned techniques in a practical example will give you a great starting point for improving your LLM-supported programs. If you’ve never worked with an LLM before, then you may want to peruse [OpenAI’s GPT documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) before diving in, but you should be able to follow along either way.\\n\\n## Get to Know the Practical Prompt Engineering Project[](#get-to-know-the-practical-prompt-engineering-project \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ll explore various prompt engineering techniques in service of a practical example: [sanitizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sanitization) customer chat conversations. By practicing different prompt engineering techniques on a single real-world project, you’ll get a good idea of why you might want to use one technique over another and how you can apply them in practice.\\n\\nImagine that you’re the resident Python developer at a company that handles thousands of customer support chats on a daily basis. Your job is to format and sanitize these conversations. You also help with deciding which of them require additional attention.\\n\\n### Collect Your Tasks[](#collect-your-tasks \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYour big-picture assignment is to help your company stay on top of handling customer chat conversations. The conversations that you work with may look like the one shown below:\\n\\nYou’re supposed to make these text conversations more accessible for further processing by the customer support department in a few different ways:\\n> - Remove personally identifiable information.\\n> - Remove swear words.\\n> - Clean the date-time information to only show the date.\\n\\nThe swear words that you’ll encounter in this tutorial won’t be spicy at all, but you can consider them stand-ins for more explicit phrasing that you might find out in the wild. After sanitizing the chat conversation, you’d expect it to look like this:\\n\\nSure—you could handle it [using Python’s `str.replace()`](https://realpython.com/replace-string-python/) or [show off](https://xkcd.com/208) your [regular expression](https://realpython.com/regex-python/) skills. But there’s more to the task than immediately meets the eye.\\n\\nYour project manager isn’t a technical person, and they stuck another task at the end of this list. They may think of the task as a normal continuation of the previous tasks. But you know that it requires an entirely different approach and technology stack:\\n> Mark the conversations as “positive” or “negative.”\\n\\nThat task lies in the realm of [machine learning](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/machine-learning-python/), namely [text classification](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/), and more specifically [sentiment analysis](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/). Even [advanced regex skills](https://realpython.com/regex-python-part-2/) won’t get you far in this challenge.\\n\\nAdditionally, you know that the customer support team that you’re preparing the data for will want to continue working on it programmatically. Plain text isn’t necessarily the best format for doing that. You want to do work that’s useful for others, so you add yet another stretch goal to your growing list of tasks:\\n> Format the output as JSON.\\n\\nThis task list is quickly growing out of proportion! Fortunately, you’ve got access to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/), and you’ll employ the help of their LLM to solve all of these challenges.\\n\\nOne of the impressive features of LLMs is the breadth of tasks that you can use them for. So you’ll cover a lot of ground and different areas of use. And you’ll learn how to tackle them all with prompt engineering techniques.\\n\\n### Prepare Your Tools[](#prepare-your-tools \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need to know how to [run a Python script](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) from your command-line interface (CLI), and you’ll need an [API key from OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).\\n\\nYou’ll focus on prompt engineering, so you’ll only use the CLI app as a tool to demonstrate the different techniques. However, if you want to understand the code that you’ll be using, then it’ll help to have some experience with [Python classes](https://realpython.com/python-classes/), [defining your own Python functions](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/), [the name-main idiom](https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/), and [using Python to interact with web APIs](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/).\\n\\nTo get started, go ahead and download the example Python script that you’ll work with throughout the tutorial:\\n\\nThe codebase represents a light abstraction layer on top of the OpenAI API and exposes one function called `get_chat_completion()` that’ll be of primary interest for the tutorial. The function interacts with OpenAI’s [`/chat/completions` endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) to generate responses using different models, such as **GPT-3.5-Turbo** and **GPT-4**. You’ll explore both models, starting with GPT-3.5-Turbo, and eventually you’ll move on to the more powerful GPT-4 model.\\n\\nMost of the code in `app.py` revolves around setting up and fetching the settings from `settings.toml`.\\n\\nThe script also parses a command-line argument to allow you to conveniently specify an input file.\\nThe input files that you’ll primarily work with contain [LLM-generated customer support chat conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08082), but feel free to reuse the script and provide your own input text files for additional practice.\\n\\nThe heart of the codebase is `settings.toml`. This [TOML settings file](https://realpython.com/python-toml/) hosts the prompts that you’ll use to sharpen your prompt engineering skills. It contains different prompts formatted in the human-readable settings format TOML.\\n\\nKeeping your prompts in a dedicated settings file can help to put them under [version control](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/), which means you can keep track of different versions of your prompts, which will inevitably change during development.\\n\\nYour Python script will read the prompts from `settings.toml`, assemble them meaningfully, and send an API requests to OpenAI.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can also run all the text prompts directly in the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), which will give you the same functionality as the script. You could even paste the prompts into the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) interface. However, the results will vary because you’ll be interacting with a different model and won’t have the opportunity to change certain settings.\\n\\n### Set Up the Codebase[](#set-up-the-codebase \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nMake sure that you’re on [Python 3.11](https://realpython.com/python311-new-features/) or higher, so that you can [interact with TOML files](https://realpython.com/python311-tomllib/) using the standard library. If you haven’t downloaded the codebase yet, go ahead and click the link below:\\n\\nUnzip the folder and use your CLI to navigate into the folder. You’ll see a handful of files. The most important ones are `app.py` and `settings.toml`:\\n\\n    ./\\n    ├── LICENSE\\n    ├── README.md\\n    ├── app.py\\n    ├── chats.txt\\n    ├── requirements.txt\\n    ├── sanitized-chats.txt\\n    ├── sanitized-testing-chats.txt\\n    ├── settings.toml\\n    ├── settings-final.toml\\n    └── testing-chats.txt\\n\\nThe file `settings.toml` contains placeholders for all the prompts that you’ll use to explore the different prompt engineering techniques. That’s the file that you’ll primarily work with, so open it up. You’ll use it to iteratively develop the prompts for your application.\\n\\nThe file `app.py` contains the Python code that ties the codebase together. You’ll run this script many times throughout the tutorial, and it’ll take care of pulling your prompts from `settings.toml`.\\n\\nAfter you’ve downloaded and unpacked the codebase, create and activate a new [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). Then use [`pip`](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) to install the required dependencies:\\n\\nNote that this tutorial uses `openai` version 1.13.3. OpenAI may introduce breaking changes between API versions, so make sure that you install the pinned dependencies from the requirements file. Then you’ll be able to work through the tutorial without any hiccups.\\n\\nTo run the script successfully, you’ll need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) with which to authenticate your API requests. Make sure to keep that key private and never commit it to version control! If you’re new to using API keys, then read up on [best practices for API key safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).\\n\\nTo integrate your API key with the script and avoid leaking it publicly, you can export the API key as an environment variable:\\n\\nAfter you’ve added your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the script will automatically pick it up during each run.\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve completed the necessary setup steps. You can now run the script using the command line and provide it with a file as additional input text:\\n\\nThe command shown above combines the customer support chat conversations in `chats.txt` with prompts and API call parameters that are saved in `settings.toml`, then sends a request to the OpenAI API. Finally, it prints the resulting text completion to your terminal.\\n\\nFrom now on, you’ll primarily make changes in `settings.toml`. The code in `app.py` is just here for your convenience, and you won’t have to edit that file at all. The changes in the LLM’s output will come from changing the prompts and a few of the API call arguments.\\n\\n### Freeze Responses by Setting the Temperature to Zero[](#freeze-responses-by-setting-the-temperature-to-zero \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nWhen you’re planning to integrate an LLM into a product or a workflow, then you’ll generally want deterministic responses. The same input should give you the same output. Otherwise, it gets hard to provide a consistent service or debug your program if something goes wrong.\\n\\nBecause of this, you’ll want to set the [`temperature` argument](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature) of your API calls to `0`. This value will mean that you’ll get *mostly* deterministic results.\\n\\nLLMs do text completion by predicting the next token based on the probability that it follows the previous tokens. Higher `temperature` settings will introduce more randomness into the results by allowing the LLM to pick tokens with lower probabilities. Because there are so many token selections chained one after one the other, picking one different token can sometimes lead to vastly different results.\\n\\nIf you use the LLM to generate ideas or [alternative implementations](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python/#prompt-chatgpt-for-alternative-implementations) of a programming task, then higher values for `temperature` might be interesting. However, they’re generally undesirable when you build a product.\\n\\nIn the example codebase, you can adjust `temperature` right inside your `settings.toml` file:\\n\\nThe initial value is set at `0`. All the examples in this tutorial assume that you leave `temperature` at `0` so that you’ll get mostly deterministic results. If you want to experiment with how a higher temperature changes the output, then feel free to play with it by changing the value for `temperature` in this settings file.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that you won’t be able to achieve true determinism with the current LLM models offered by OpenAI even if you keep `temperature` at `0`:\\n> An edge-case in GPT-3 with big implications: Inference is non-deterministic (even at temperature=0) when top-2 token probabilities are <1% different. So temperature=0 output is *very close* to deterministic, but actually isn’t. Worth remembering. ([Source](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1608525976702525440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw))\\n\\nSo, while you can’t entirely guarantee that the model will always return the same result, you can get much closer by setting `temperature` to `0`.\\n\\nAnother approach that improves determinism in the results is to set a value for [the `seed` parameter](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter). The provided code sets the seed to `12345`. However, this only has an effect on some of the models.\\n\\n## Start Engineering Your Prompts[](#start-engineering-your-prompts \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nNow that you have an understanding of prompt engineering and the practical project that you’ll be working with, it’s time to dive into some prompt engineering techniques. In this section, you’ll learn how to apply the following techniques to your prompts to get the desired output from the language model:\\n\\n- **Zero-shot prompting:** Giving the language model normal instructions without any additional context\\n- **Few-shot prompting:** Conditioning the model on a few examples to boost its performance\\n- **Using delimiters:** Adding special tokens or phrases to provide structure and instructions to the model\\n- **Detailed, numbered steps:** Breaking down a complex prompt into a series of small, specific steps\\n\\n\\nBy practicing these techniques with the customer chat conversation example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how prompt engineering can enhance the capabilities of language models and improve their usefulness in real-world applications.\\n\\n### Describe Your Task[](#describe-your-task \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ll start your prompt engineering journey with a concept called **zero-shot prompting**, which is just a fancy way of saying that you’re asking a question or describing a task:\\n> Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date, and replace all swear words with “😤”\\n\\nThis task description focuses on the requested steps for sanitizing the customer chat conversation and literally spells them out. This is the prompt that’s currently saved as `instruction_prompt` in the `settings.toml` file:\\n\\nIf you run the Python script and provide the support chat file as an argument, then it’ll send this prompt together with the content of `chats.txt` to OpenAI’s text completion API:\\n\\nIf you correctly installed the dependencies and added your OpenAI API key as an environment variable, then all you need to do is wait until you see the API response pop up in your terminal:\\n\\nIn the example output, you can see that the prompt that you provided didn’t do a good job tackling the tasks. And that’s putting it gently! It picked up that it should do something with the huffing emoji and reduce the [ISO date-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) to only a date. Your results might not have tackled all of that. Overall, nearly all of the work is left undone and the output is useless.\\n\\nIf you’re new to interacting with LLMs, then this may have been a first attempt at outsourcing your development work to the text completion model. But these initial results aren’t exactly exhilarating.\\n\\nSo you’ve described the task in natural language and gotten a bad result. But don’t fret—throughout the tutorial you’ll learn how you can get more useful responses for your task.\\n\\nOne way to do that is by increasing the number of **shots**, or examples, that you give to the model. When you’ve given the model zero shots, the only way to go is up! That’s why you’ll improve your results through **few-shot prompting** in the next section.\\n\\n### Use Few-Shot Prompting to Improve Output[](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nFew-shot prompting is a prompt engineering technique where you provide example tasks and their expected solutions in your prompt. So, instead of just describing the task like you did before, you’ll now add an example of a chat conversation and its sanitized version.\\n\\nOpen up `settings.toml` and change your `instruction_prompt` by adding such an example:\\n\\nOnce you’ve applied the change, give the LLM another chance to sanitize the chat conversations for you by running the script again:\\n\\nYou’ll have to wait for the LLM to predict all the tokens. When it’s done, you’ll see a fresh response pop up in your terminal:\\n\\nOkay, great! This time at least the LLM didn’t eat up all the information that you passed to it without giving anything useful back!\\n\\nThis time, the model tackled some of the tasks. For example, it sanitized the names in square brackets. However, the names of the customers are still visible in the actual conversations. It also didn’t censor the order numbers or the email address.\\n\\nThe model probably didn’t sanitize any of the names in the conversations or the order numbers because the chat that you provided didn’t contain any names or order numbers. In other words, the output that you provided didn’t show an example of redacting names, order numbers, or email addresses in the conversation text.\\n\\nHere you can see how important it is to choose good examples that clearly represent the output that you want.\\n\\nSo far, you’ve provided *one* example in your prompt. To cover more ground, you’ll add another example so that this part of your prompt truly puts the *few* in few-shot prompting:\\n\\nYou added a second example that contains both a customer name as well as an order number in the chat text body. The example of a sanitized chat shows both types of sensitive data replaced with a sequence of asterisks (`****`). Now you’ve given the LLM a good example to *model*.\\n\\nAfter editing `instruction_prompt` in `settings.toml`, run your script again and wait for the response to print to your terminal:\\n\\nWait? Where did most of the output go? You probably expected to see better results, but it looks like you’re getting only two of the conversations back this time!\\n\\nYou’ve added more text to your prompt. At this point, the task instructions probably make up proportionally too few tokens for the model to consider them in a meaningful way. The model lost track of what it was supposed to do with the text that you provided.\\n\\nAdding more examples should make your responses stronger instead of eating them up, so what’s the deal? You can trust that few-shot prompting works—it’s a widely used and very effective prompt engineering technique. To help the model distinguish which part of your prompt contains the instructions that it should follow, you can use *delimiters*.\\n\\n### Use Delimiters to Clearly Mark Sections of Your Prompt[](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you’re working with content that needs specific inputs, or if you provide examples like you did in the previous section, then it can be very helpful to clearly mark specific sections of the prompt. Keep in mind that everything you write arrives to an LLM as a single prompt—a long sequence of tokens.\\n\\nYou can improve the output by using delimiters to fence and label specific parts of your prompt. In fact, if you’ve been running the example code, then you’ve already used delimiters to fence the content that you’re reading from file.\\n\\nThe script adds the delimiters when assembling the prompt in `app.py`:\\n\\nIn line 13, you wrap the chat content in between `>>>>>` and `<<<<<` delimiters. Marking parts of your prompt with delimiters can help the model keep track of which tokens it should consider as a single unit of meaning.\\n\\nYou’ve seen in the previous section that missing delimiters can lead to unexpected results. You might receive less output than expected, like in the previous example, or an empty response. But you might also receive output that’s quite different from what you want! For example, imagine that the chat content that you’re reformatting contains a question at the end, such as:\\n> Can you give me your order number?\\n\\nIf this question is the last line of your prompt without delimiters, then the LLM might continue the imaginary chat conversation by answering the question with an imaginary order number. Give it a try by adding such a sentence to the end of your current prompt!\\n\\nDelimiters can help to separate the content and examples from the task description. They can also make it possible to refer to specific parts of your prompt at a later point in the prompt.\\n\\nA delimiter can be any **sequence of characters** that usually *wouldn’t* appear together, for example:\\n\\n- `>>>>>`\\n- `====`\\n- `####`\\n\\n\\nThe number of characters that you use doesn’t matter too much, as long as you make sure that the sequence is relatively unique. Additionally, you can add labels just before or just after the delimiters:\\n\\n- `START CONTENT>>>>>` content `<<<<<END CONTENT`\\n- `==== START` content `END ====`\\n- `#### START EXAMPLES` examples `#### END EXAMPLES`\\n\\n\\nThe exact formatting also doesn’t matter so much. As long as you mark the sections so that a casual reader could understand where a unit of meaning begins and ends, then you’ve properly applied delimiters.\\n\\nEdit your prompt in `settings.toml` to add a clear reference to your delimited content, and also include a delimiter for the examples that you’ve added:\\n\\nWith these adaptations to your `instruction_prompt`, you now specifically reference the content as `>>>>>CONTENT<<<<<` in your task description. These delimiters match the delimiters that the code in `app.py` adds when assembling the prompt.\\n\\nYou’ve also delimited the examples that you’re providing with `#### START EXAMPLES` and `#### END EXAMPLES`, and you differentiate between the inputs and expected outputs using multiple dashes (`------`) as delimiters.\\n\\nWhile delimiters can help you to get better results, in this case your output is quite similar to before:\\n\\nIt’s noticeable that the model only shows the two example data that you passed as examples. Could it be that your prompt leads to something similar like [overfitting](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/#underfitting-and-overfitting)? Using the actual data that you want to sanitize as your training data is, anyway, not a good idea, so in the next section, you’ll make sure to change that.\\n\\nIn this section, you’ve learned how you can clarify the different parts of your prompt using delimiters. You marked which part of the prompt is the task description and which part contains the customer support chat conversations, as well as the examples of original input and expected sanitized output.\\n\\n### Test Your Prompt Across Different Data[](#test-your-prompt-across-different-data \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nSo far, you’ve created your few-shot examples from the same data that you also run the sanitation on. This means that you’re effectively using your test data to provide context to the model. Mixing training, validation, and testing data is a bad practice in machine learning. You might wonder how well your prompt generalizes to different input.\\n\\nTo test this out, run the script another time with the same prompt using the second file that contains chat conversations, `testing-chats.txt`. The conversations in this file contain different names, and different—soft—swear words:\\n\\nYou’ll keep running your script using `testing-chats.txt` moving forward, unless indicated differently.\\n\\nOnce you’ve waited for the LLM to generate and return the response, you’ll notice that the result isn’t very satisfying:\\n\\nThe model now understands that you meant the examples as examples to follow when applying edits and gives you back all of the new input data. However, it didn’t do a great job following the instructions.\\n\\nThe model didn’t identify new swear words and didn’t replace them. The model also didn’t redact the order numbers, nor did it anonymize the names. It looks like it only managed to reformat your date strings.\\n\\nSo your engineered prompt currently doesn’t work well, and generalizes even worse. If you built a pipeline based on this prompt, where new chats could contain new customer names, then the application would probably continue to perform poorly. How can you fix that?\\n\\nYou’ve grown your prompt significantly by providing more examples, but your task description is still largely just the question that you wrote right at the beginning. To get better results, you’ll need to do some prompt engineering on the task description as well.\\n\\n### Describe Your Request in Numbered Steps[](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you break up your task instructions into a numbered sequence of small steps, then the model is a lot more likely to produce the results that you’re looking for.\\n\\nGo back to your prompt in `settings.toml` and break your initial task description into more granular, specific substeps:\\n\\nWith these step-by-step instructions in place, you’re ready for another run of your script and another inspection of the newly generated output:\\n\\nThat’s a significant improvement! The model managed to follow the pattern of replacing the names in square brackets with `[Agent]` and `[Customer]`, respectively. It correctly identified some new swear words and replaced them with the huffing emoji. The model also redacted the order numbers, and anonymized the names in the conversation texts.\\n\\nOften, one of the best approaches to get better results from an LLM is to make your instructions more specific.\\n\\nFraming your tasks in even smaller and more specific steps, will generally get you better results. Don’t shy away from [some repetition](https://twitter.com/phillip_isola/status/1532189616106881027):\\n\\nIncreasing the specificity of your instructions, and introducing numbered steps, helped you create a well-performing prompt. Your prompt successfully removes personally identifiable information from the conversations, redacts swear words, and reformats the ISO date-time stamp, as well as the usernames.\\n\\nYou could consider your initial task as completed, but there’s more that you want to do, and more prompt engineering techniques to explore. You also know that there are newer models that you could work with, and your success has further piqued your curiosity. It’s time to switch to a different LLM, see how that influences your output, and then continue exploring other techniques.\\n\\n## Perform Chat Completions With GPT-4[](#perform-chat-completions-with-gpt-4 \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ve decided to switch to an even more powerful LLM, GPT-4. In the rest of this tutorial, you’ll use GPT-4 to continue exploring other important prompt engineering techniques:\\n\\n1. **Role prompting**: Using a system message to set the tone of the conversation, and using different roles to give context through labeling\\n2. **Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT)**: Giving the model time to think by prompting it to reason about a task, then including the reasoning in the prompt\\n\\n\\nYou’ll also use GPT-4 to **classify the sentiment** of each chat conversation and structure the output format as **JSON**.\\n\\n### Switch to a Different Model[](#switch-to-a-different-model \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you’re working with the provided script, then all you need to do is pick a chat model from `chat_models` in `settings.toml` and use it as the new value for `model`:\\n\\nChanging these settings will send your request to a different model. Like before, it’ll assemble your prompt in the way necessary for a `/chat/completions` endpoint request, make that request for you, and print the response to your terminal.\\n\\nFor the rest of this tutorial, you’ll work with OpenAI’s latest version of the GPT-4 model. If you don’t have access to this model, then you can instead keep working with the model that you’ve been working with so far.\\n\\nIf you’ve been following along using ChatGPT, then you’re stuck with whatever model currently powers it. Unless you’re a [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) subscriber, then you can [change the model to GPT-4](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7127997-how-can-i-use-gpt-4-in-chatgpt) on the website.\\n\\nWithout changing your prompt, run your script another time to see the different results of the text completion based only on using a different LLM:\\n\\nSome responses may be relatively similar to the ones with the older model. However, you can also expect to receive results like the one shown above, where most swear words are still present.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that developing for a specific model will lead to specific results, and swapping the model may improve or deteriorate the responses that you get. Therefore, swapping to a newer and more powerful model won’t necessarily give you better results straight away.\\n\\nAdditionally, it’s also helpful to keep in mind that API calls to larger models will generally [cost more money per request](https://openai.com/pricing). While it can be fun to always use the latest and greatest LLM, it may be worthwhile to consider whether you really need to upgrade to tackle the task that you’re trying to solve.\\n\\n### Add a Role Prompt to Set the Tone[](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nThere are some additional possibilities when interacting with the API endpoint that you’ve only used implicitly, but haven’t explored yet, such as adding **role labels** to a part of the prompt. In this section, you’ll use the `\\\"system\\\"` role to create a system message, and you’ll revisit the concept later on when you [add more roles](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) to improve the output.\\n\\n**Role prompting** usually refers to adding system messages, which represent information that helps to set the context for upcoming completions that the model will produce. System messages usually aren’t visible to the end user. Keep in mind that the `/chat/completions` endpoint models were initially designed for conversational interactions.\\n\\nYou can also use system messages to set a context for your completion task. You’ll craft a bespoke role prompt in a moment. However, for this specific task, the role prompt is likely less important than it might be for some other tasks. To explore the possible influence of a role prompt, you’ll take a little detour and ask your model to play a role:\\n\\nYou keep `instruction_prompt` the same as you engineered it earlier in the tutorial. Additionally, you now add text to `role_prompt`. The role prompt shown above serves as an example for the impact that a misguided prompt can have on your application.\\n\\nUnleash, thou shall, the parchment’s code and behold the marvels unexpected, as the results may stir wonderment and awe:\\n\\nAs you can see, a role prompt can have quite an impact on the language that the LLM uses to construct the response. This is great if you’re building a conversational agent that should speak in a certain tone or language. And you can also use system messages to keep specific setup information present.\\n\\nFor completion tasks like the one that you’re currently working on, you might, however, not need this type of role prompt. For now, you could give it a common boilerplate phrase, such as *You’re a helpful assistant*.\\n\\nTo practice writing a role prompt—and to see whether you can release your customer chat conversations from the reign of that 16th century villain poet—you’ll craft a more appropriate role prompt:\\n\\nThis role prompt is more appropriate to your use case. You don’t want the model to introduce randomness or to change any of the language that’s used in the conversations. Instead, you just want it to execute the tasks that you describe. Run the script another time and take a look at the results:\\n\\nThat looks much better again! Abide concealed in yonder bygone era, ye villainous poet!\\n\\nAs you can see from these examples, role prompts can be a powerful way to change your output. Especially if you’re using the LLM to build a conversational interface, then they’re a force to consider.\\n\\nFor some reason, GPT-4 seems to consistently pick `[Client]` over `[Customer]`, even though you’re specifying `[Customer]` in the few-shot examples. You’ll eventually get rid of these verbose names, so it doesn’t matter for your use case.\\n\\nHowever, if you’re determined and curious—and manage to prompt `[Client]` away—then share the prompt that worked for you in the comments.\\n\\nIn the final section of this tutorial, you’ll revisit using roles and see how you can employ [the power of conversation](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) to improve your output even in a non-conversational completion task like the one you’re working on.\\n\\n### Classify the Sentiment of Chat Conversations[](#classify-the-sentiment-of-chat-conversations \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve engineered a decent prompt that seems to perform quite well in sanitizing and reformatting the provided customer chat conversations. To fully grasp the power of LLM-assisted workflows, you’ll next tackle the tacked-on request by your manager to also classify the conversations as positive or negative.\\n\\nStart by saving both sanitized conversation files into new files that will constitute the new inputs for your sentiment classification task:\\n\\nYou could continue to build on top of the previous prompt, but eventually you’ll hit a wall when you’re asking the model to do too many edits at once. The classification step is conceptually distinct from the text sanitation, so it’s a good cut-off point to start a new pipeline.\\n\\nThe sanitized chat conversation files are also included in the example codebase:\\n\\nAgain, you want the model to do the work for you. All you need to do is craft a prompt that spells out the task at hand, and provide examples. You can also edit the role prompt to set the context for this new task that the model should perform:\\n\\nYou can now run the script and provide it with the sanitized conversations in `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` that were the output of your previously engineered prompt:\\n\\nYou added another step to your task description and slightly modified the few-shot examples in your prompt. Not a lot of extra work for a task that would have required a lot more work without the help of an LLM. But is this really sufficient? Take a look at the output once your script has finished running:\\n\\nThe output is quite promising! The model correctly labeled conversations with angry customers with the fire emoji. However, the first conversation probably doesn’t entirely fit into the same bucket as the rest because the customer doesn’t display a negative sentiment towards the company.\\n\\nAssume that all of these conversations were resolved positively by the customer service agents and that your company just wants to follow up with those customers who seemed noticeably angry with their situation. In that case, you might need to tweak your prompt a bit more to get the desired result.\\n\\nYou could [add more examples](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output), which is generally a good idea because it creates more context for the model to apply. Writing a [more detailed description](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps) of your task helps as well, as you’ve seen before. However, to tackle this task, you’ll learn about another useful prompt engineering technique called *chain-of-thought* prompting.\\n\\n### Walk the Model Through Chain-of-Thought Prompting[](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nA widely successful prompt engineering approach can be summed up with the [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) of *giving the model time to think*. You can do this with a couple of different specific techniques. Essentially, it means that you prompt the LLM to produce intermediate results that become additional inputs. That way, the reasoning doesn’t need to take distant leaps but only hop from one lily pad to the next.\\n\\nOne of these approaches is to use **chain-of-thought (CoT)** prompting techniques. To apply CoT, you prompt the model to generate intermediate results that then become part of the prompt in a second request. The increased context makes it more likely that the model will arrive at a useful output.\\n\\nThe smallest form of CoT prompting is **zero-shot CoT**, where you literally ask the model to *think step by step*. This approach yields [impressive results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) for mathematical tasks that LLMs otherwise often solve incorrectly.\\n\\nChain-of-thought operations are technically split into two stages:\\n\\n1. **Reasoning extraction**, where the model generates the increased context\\n2. **Answer extraction**, where the model uses the increased context to generate the answer\\n\\n\\nReasoning extraction is useful across a variety of CoT contexts. You can generate few-shot examples from input, which you can then use for a separate step of extracting answers using more detailed chain-of-thought prompting.\\n\\nYou can try zero-shot CoT on the sanitized chat conversations to embellish the few-shot examples that you’ll use to classify the chat conversations more robustly. Remove the examples and replace the instructions describing the reasoning on how you would classify the conversations in more detail:\\n\\nYou spelled out the criteria that you want the model to use to assess and classify sentiment. Then you add the sentence *Let’s think step by step* to the end of your prompt.\\n\\nYou want to use this zero-shot CoT approach to generate few-shot examples that you’ll then build into your final prompt. Therefore, you should run the script using the data in `sanitized-chats.txt` this time:\\n\\nYou’ll get back a reference to the conversations, with the reasoning spelled out step by step to reach the final conclusion:\\n\\nThe reasoning is straightforward and sticks to your instructions. If the instructions accurately represent the criteria for marking a conversation as positive or negative, then you’ve got a good playbook at hand.\\n\\nYou can now use this information to improve the few-shot examples for your sentiment classification task:\\n\\nYou’re using the same examples as previously, but you’ve enhanced each of the examples with a short chain of thought that you generated in the previous call. Give your script another spin using `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` as the input file and see whether the results have improved:\\n\\nGreat! Now the first conversation, which was initially classified as negative, has also received the green checkmark.\\n\\nIn this section, you’ve supported your examples with reasoning for why a conversation should be labeled as positive vs negative. You generated this reasoning with another call to the LLM.\\n\\nAt this point, it seems that your prompt generalizes well to the available data and classifies the conversations as intended. And you only needed to carefully craft your words to make it happen!\\n\\n### Structure Your Output Format as JSON[](#structure-your-output-format-as-json \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nAs a final showcase for effective prompting when incorporating an LLM into your workflow, you’ll tackle the last task, which you added to the list youself: to pass the data on in a structured format that’ll make it straightforward for the customer support team to process further.\\n\\nYou already specified a format to follow in the previous prompt, and the LLM returned what you asked for. So it might just be a matter of asking for a different, more structured format, for example [JSON](https://realpython.com/python-json/):\\n\\nIn your updated `instruction_prompt`, you’ve explicitly asked the model to return the output as valid JSON. Then, you also adapted your few-shot examples to represent the JSON output that you want to receive. Note that you also applied additional formatting by removing the date from each line of conversation and truncating the `[Agent]` and `[Customer]` labels to single letters, `A` and `C`.\\n\\nYou’re still using example chat conversations from your sanitized chat data in `sanitized-chats.txt`, and you send the sanitized testing data from `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` to the model for processing.\\n\\nIn this case, you receive valid JSON, as requested. The classification still works as before and the output censors personally identifiable information, replaces swear words, and applies all the additional requested formatting:\\n\\nYour output may be different and show some small hiccups, but overall, this output is quite impressive and useful! You could pass this JSON structure over to the customer support team, and they could quickly integrate it into their workflow to follow up with customers who displayed a negative sentiment in the chat conversation.\\n\\nYou could stop here, but the engineer in you isn’t quite satisfied yet. All the instructions just in a single prompt? Your premonition calls and tells you tales about maintainability. In the next section, you’ll refactor your prompts to apply role labels before you set up your LLM-assisted pipeline and call it a day.\\n\\n### Improve Your Output With the Power of Conversation[](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou added a [role prompt](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone) earlier on, but otherwise you haven’t tapped into the power of *conversations* yet.\\n\\nIn this final section, you’ll learn how you can provide additional context to the model by splitting your prompt into multiple separate messages with different labels.\\n\\nIn calls to the `/chat/completions` endpoint, a prompt is split into several **messages**. Each message has its content, which represents the prompt text. Additionally, it also has a **role**. There are [different roles](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-role) that a message can have, and you’ll work with three of them:\\n\\n1. `\\\"system\\\"` gives context for the conversation and helps to set the overall tone.\\n2. `\\\"user\\\"` represents the input that a user of your application might provide.\\n3. `\\\"assistant\\\"` represents the output that the model would reply with.\\n\\n\\nSo far, you’ve provided context for different parts of your prompt all mashed together in a single prompt, more or less well separated [using delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt). When you use a model that’s optimized for chat, such as GPT-4, then you can use roles to let the LLM know what type of message you’re sending.\\n\\nFor example, you can create some variables for your few-shot examples and separate variables for the associated CoT reasoning and outputs:\\n\\nYou’ve disassembled your `instruction_prompt` into seven separate prompts, based on what role the messages have in your conversation with the LLM.\\n\\nThe helper function that builds a messages payload, `_assemble_chat_messages()`, is already set up to include all of these prompts in the API request. Take a look into `app.py` to check out the separate messages, with their fitting roles, that make up your overall prompt:\\n\\nYour prompt is now split into distinct parts, each of which has a certain role label:\\n\\n- **Example input** has the `\\\"user\\\"` role.\\n- **Reasoning** that the model created has the `\\\"system\\\"` role.\\n- **Example output** has the `\\\"assistant\\\"` role.\\n\\n\\nYou’re now providing context for how user input might look, how the model can reason about classifying the input, and how your expected output should look. You removed the delimiters that you previously used for labeling the example sections. They aren’t necessary now that you’re providing context for the parts of your prompt through separate messages.\\n\\nGive your script a final run to see whether the power of conversation has managed to improve the output:\\n\\nThis JSON structure is looking legitimately great! The formatting that you wanted now shows up throughout, and the conversations are labeled correctly.\\n\\nAdditionally, you’ve improved the maintainability of your prompts by splitting them into separate labels. You can feel proud to pass on such a useful edit of the customer chat conversation data to your coworkers!\\n\\n## FAQs[](#faqs \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ve covered common prompt engineering techniques, and here, you’ll find a few questions and answers that sum up the most important concepts that you’ve covered in this tutorial.\\n\\nYou can use these questions to check your understanding or to recap and solidify what you’ve just learned. After each question, you’ll find a brief explanation hidden in a collapsible section. Click the *Show/Hide* toggle to reveal the answer. Time to dive in!\\n\\nKnowledge about prompt engineering is crucial when you work with large language models (LLMs) because you can receive [much better results](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps) with carefully crafted prompts.\\n\\nThe `temperature` setting controls the [amount of randomness](#freeze-responses-by-setting-the-temperature-to-zero) in your output. Setting the `temperature` argument of API calls to `0` will increase consistency in the responses from the LLM. Note that OpenAI’s LLMs are only ever *mostly* deterministic, even with the temperature set to `0`.\\n\\n[Few-shot prompting](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output) is a common prompt engineering technique where you add examples of expected input and desired output to your prompt.\\n\\n[Using delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt) can be helpful when dealing with more complex prompts. Delimiters help to separate and label sections of the prompt, assisting the LLM in understanding its tasks better.\\n\\n[Testing your prompt](#test-your-prompt-across-different-data) with data that’s separate from the training data is important to see how well the model generalizes to new conditions.\\n\\nYes, generally adding more context will lead to more accurate results. However, it’s also important *how* you add the additional context. [Just adding more text](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output) may lead to worse results.\\n\\n[Role prompting](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone) means providing a system message that sets the tone or context for a conversation. This can greatly impact how the model constructs the response. You can also [use roles to provide context labels](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) for parts of your prompt.\\n\\nIn [chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting), you prompt the LLM to produce intermediate reasoning steps. You can then include these steps in the answer extraction step to receive better results.\\n\\n## Next Steps[](#next-steps \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you’ve learned about various prompt engineering techniques, and you’ve built an LLM-assisted Python application along the way. If you’d like to learn more about prompt engineering, then check out some related questions, as well as some resources for further study below:\\n\\nYes, prompt engineer can be a real job, especially in the context of AI and machine learning. As a prompt engineer, you design and optimize prompts so that AI models like GPT-4 produce desired responses. However, it might not be a stand-alone job title everywhere. It could be a part of broader roles like [machine learning](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/machine-learning-python/) engineer or [data scientist](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/data-science-python-core-skills/).\\n\\nPrompt engineering, like any other technical skill, requires time, effort, and practice to learn. It’s not necessarily easy, but it’s certainly possible for someone with the right mindset and resources to learn it. If you’ve enjoyed the iterative and text-based approach that you learned about [in this tutorial](#understand-the-purpose-of-prompt-engineering), then prompt engineering might be a good fit for you.\\n\\nThe field of prompt engineering is quite new, and LLMs keep developing quickly as well. The landscape, best practices, and most effective approaches are therefore changing rapidly. To continue learning about prompt engineering using free and open-source resources, you can check out [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro/) and the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/).\\n\\nHave you found any interesting ways to incorporate an LLM into your workflow?

You'll revisit how to work with OpenAI's API, apply prompt engineering techniques to practical examples, and use various strategies to improve your results.\\n\\n========================\\n## Table of contents[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#table-of-contents](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#table-of-contents)\\n\\n- [Be specific with language and requirements](#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n- [Include examples and constraints](#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n- [Break down complex tasks and iterate](#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n- [Avoid common prompting pitfalls](#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n- [Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency](#graphites-Graphite Agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\n\\n[Large language models (LLMs)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/intro-llms) can generate code in many programming languages, but the quality of their output depends heavily on how you prompt them. Crafting a precise prompt can be the difference between hours of debugging and a seamless implementation. The key is to clearly communicate your intent and requirements, because an AI doesn't inherently know your goals – it only follows the patterns described in your prompt. This guide introduces language-agnostic prompt engineering techniques to help both beginners and experienced developers get more accurate and useful code from AI. We'll illustrate each technique with examples of weak vs. improved prompts to show how small changes can yield better results. For a deeper dive into how AI code review works, see our [guide on AI code review](https://graphite.com/guides/ai-code-review).\\n\\n### Be specific with language and requirements[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n\\nThe first rule of prompt engineering for code is to be specific about what you want. Vague prompts yield vague (often incorrect) results. Always mention the programming language, the task or algorithm, and any requirements or constraints. For example, consider asking an AI to generate a sorting algorithm:\\n\\n- **Weak prompt:** \\\"Write a sorting algorithm.\\\"\\n- **Improved prompt:** \\\"Write a **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** implementation of **merge sort** optimized for **memory efficiency**, including **time complexity analysis** and **error handling** for edge cases (e.g. empty arrays).\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe improved prompt is much clearer. It specifies:\\n\\n- The programming language (Python) and specific algorithm (merge sort).\\n- The optimization goal (memory efficiency) and required output details (time complexity analysis).\\n- Error handling expectations and an edge case to consider (empty arrays).\\n\\n\\nBy spelling out these details, you greatly reduce ambiguity. [Microsoft's Developer Tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/) research group observed that prompts with explicit specifications reduced the need for back-and-forth refinements by 68%. In practice, this means the AI is more likely to produce correct, ready-to-use code on the first try.\\n\\nBeing specific also means providing technical context when relevant. If certain constraints matter – such as the target environment, API version, performance or security requirements – include them in the prompt. For instance, specify \\\"Node.js 18 server environment\\\" or \\\"Python 3.10+\\\" if it matters. Otherwise, the model might generate code that is technically correct but not suitable for your situation.\\n> **Tip:** AI code review tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) can help enforce technical requirements and catch missing context.\\n\\n### Include examples and constraints[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n\\nAnother powerful technique is to provide examples or test cases in your prompt. Examples act as implicit constraints, guiding the model toward the format or behavior you expect. For instance, if you want a function with a specific signature or output format, show a snippet of that.\\n\\nImagine you need an email validation function. A weak prompt might just say, \\\"Validate an email address.\\\" An improved prompt would describe requirements and give a usage example, e.g.:\\n> **Prompt:** \\\"Create a TypeScript function `validateEmail(email: string): {isValid: boolean; message: string}` that checks if an email is RFC-5322 compliant and rejects disposable domains. For example, if the input is `\\\"test@tempmail.com\\\"`, it should return an object like `{ isValid: false, message: 'Disposable domain not allowed' }`.\\\"\\n\\nIn this improved version, the prompt lists specific rules (RFC compliance and no disposable domains) and provides a clear function signature and an example of expected output. This gives the AI a template to follow and boundaries to respect. As Dr. Rachel Thomas of fast.ai notes, *\\\"examples in prompts serve as implicit constraints that guide the model toward the desired output format.\\\"* By including a small example or an outline of the output, you help the model understand exactly what you want.\\n\\n### Break down complex tasks and iterate[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n\\nIf your desired output is complex, avoid requesting everything in one huge prompt. It's often better to break down a complex task into smaller steps or use an iterative approach. Large models can handle reasonably detailed prompts, but asking for a full application in one go is likely to produce a convoluted or partial answer. Instead, tackle complex tasks in stages and possibly across multiple prompts:\\n\\n1. **Decompose the problem:** Outline sub-tasks in separate prompts (e.g. first define the data model, then the API endpoints, then the UI components). This ensures each part is handled with focus.\\n2. **Use step-by-step reasoning:** You can actually instruct the model to \\\"think step by step.\\\" For example: \\\"I need a JavaScript function to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Let's solve this step by step: first explain the concept, then choose an algorithm (greedy vs DP), then write the code, then analyze complexity.\\\" By embedding this reasoning process in the prompt, you encourage the AI to work through the problem methodically.\\n3. **Iterate with the AI:** Treat the AI's first output as a draft. Review it, then issue follow-up prompts to refine the code.\\n\\n\\nBy breaking prompts into smaller pieces or sequential turns, you make it easier for the model to comply at each step. You also get opportunities to catch mistakes early and steer the output in the right direction. Remember that you can carry context between prompts (in a chat-based LLM) – use that to your advantage for iterative improvement.\\n\\nFor more information on [integrating AI into your code review workflow](https://graphite.com/guides/integrating-ai-code-review-workflow) and [how to review code written by AI](https://graphite.com/guides/how-to-review-code-written-by-ai), these guides offer practical advice for iterative, AI-assisted development.\\n\\n### Avoid common prompting pitfalls[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n\\nWhile applying the above techniques, watch out for a few common mistakes that can undermine your results:\\n\\n- **Under-specifying the task:** Don't assume the AI \\\"knows\\\" what you intended. If a prompt is too minimal, the model might solve the wrong problem or omit important features. Always double-check that your prompt fully describes the problem.\\n- **Ignoring context or constraints:** Failing to mention the operating environment, framework, or performance/security constraints can result in code that doesn't fit your project needs. Also make sure to include any version requirements or security considerations. Without this, you might get code that technically works but is impractical or unsafe for your use case. The more context you give, the more relevant the output.\\n- **Over-reliance on AI without verification:** Even with good prompts, AI-generated code isn't guaranteed to be perfect. The model might produce subtle logic bugs, use deprecated APIs, or just take an unconventional approach. Never merge AI-written code into production without reviewing it. Treat the AI as a coding assistant, not an infallible coder. Write prompts that encourage best practices (like asking for safe, idiomatic code), and always test and review the output thoroughly. Using linters or static analysis on AI code is also a smart safeguard.\\n> **To compare approaches:** This guide, [Automated vs. manual code reviews: Finding the right balance](https://graphite.com/guides/automated-vs-manual-code-reviews), explores the strengths and limitations of both, and how to combine them for best results.\\n\\nBy avoiding these pitfalls, you ensure that prompt engineering remains a helpful aid rather than a source of technical debt. Prompting is an iterative learning process – over time, you'll learn which clarifications or extra details yield better code from your preferred LLM.\\n\\n### Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\nWriting a good prompt is the first step, but ensuring the quality and consistency of AI-generated code is the next challenge. This is where tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) come in. Graphite Agent is an AI-powered code review assistant that provides immediate, context-aware feedback on code changes – including those written by an AI. It hooks into your development workflow (e.g. reviewing [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)) and flags issues ranging from logic bugs and security vulnerabilities to style violations and missing documentation. Graphite Agent uses your repository's context and even custom rules you define to give relevant suggestions. For example, you can configure Graphite Agent with your project's style guide or common AI mistakes to watch for, and it will catch those patterns in AI-generated code before a human reviewer even sees them.\\n\\n![screenshot of Graphite Agent comment](/images/content/guides/better-prompts-ai-code/sample-Graphite Agent-comment.png)\\n\\nBy incorporating a tool like Graphite Agent in your workflow, you add an extra layer of scrutiny for AI-produced code. It helps ensure the code meets your team's quality standards and is consistent with the rest of your codebase. In practice, Graphite Agent can automatically identify edge cases the AI missed, point out performance issues, and even suggest fixes – all of which saves human reviewers time and instills confidence in using AI-generated code.

ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21879292693140)\\n\\n========================\\nMost people treat prompting like a conversation. They type something in, hope the AI gets it, and move on. But prompting isn’t just dialog: it’s design that shapes the way the generative AI model responds. The words you use, the structure you follow, the context you provide, these might not lock in an exact output, but they point the model in the right direction.\\n\\nAnd once you start thinking that way, everything changes. Prompting stops being a guessing game and becomes a process you can test, tune, and trust. You’re not aiming for one lucky output, you’re aiming for consistency, even across edge cases, over time, and at scale.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll share 11 prompt engineering best practices that modern developers can apply right away. We’ll begin with the essentials: seven practical techniques for writing clearer, more effective prompts that deliver better results with less trial and error.\\n\\nThen we’ll shift from prompt writing to *actual* prompt engineering. Because while most advice on “prompt engineering” ends at tips for phrasing, **real engineering means treating AI behavior like a system**, something you can version, trace, and optimize like any other part of your stack.\\n\\nThat’s where our platform [Lilypad](/docs/lilypad) comes in. It’s a prompt engineering framework built for developers, designed to help them capture everything that influences an LLM’s output, from the prompt to the code that wraps it, and trace snippets back to its source. With Lilypad, teams can iterate faster, evaluate reliably, and ship AI features that actually hold up under real-world use cases.\\n\\n## 7 Fundamental Prompt Engineering Best Practices[](#7-fundamental-prompt-engineering-best-practices)\\n\\n### 1. Specify Exactly What You Want[](#1-specify-exactly-what-you-want)\\n\\nLarge language models are great at picking up on hints, but that’s not always a good thing. In zero-shot prompts, where no guidance is given beyond the task description, vague instructions are especially risky.\\n\\nIf your prompt is vague, the model will still try to guess what you meant, often filling in the blanks with assumptions that don’t match your intent.\\n\\nThat’s why clarity matters. You need to be direct about what you're asking, how it should be structured, and what to avoid. Don’t just say “make it better” or “keep it simple”: define what “better” means. Does it mean shorter sentences or a specific tone?\\n\\nAssume nothing. If your output needs to follow a certain format, stay within a word count, or match a particular style, say so. The more specific your prompt, the more likely the model is to give you what you actually want.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    Summarize this article.\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    Summarize the following article in three concise bullet points that highlight its key arguments. Avoid including any opinion or unnecessary detail.\\n\\n### 2. Show What Good Looks Like[](#2-show-what-good-looks-like)\\n\\nLLMs are fast learners, at least when it comes to patterns. That means you don’t just have to tell the model what you want. You can show it.\\n\\nBy providing examples of the kind of output you expect (for a certain input), you’re helping the model pick up on the task, the tone, the format, everything. This approach is called few-shot prompting, and it’s especially useful when your output needs to follow a certain structure or carry a bit of nuance.\\n\\nThink of examples as anchors. The model uses them to get its bearings, then generalizes from there. So pick examples that match the tone, format, and level of detail you want in return. Garbage in, garbage out, but good examples in? Much better output back.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    Generate a product description for this item: a stainless steel water bottle.\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    Here’s how I want the product description to be written:\\n    Example:\\n    Product: Wireless Ergonomic Mouse\\n    Description: A sleek, Bluetooth-enabled mouse with a contoured design for all-day comfort and precision.\\n    Now generate one for:\\n    Product: Stainless Steel Water Bottle\\n\\n### 3. Use Clear, Action-Oriented Instructions[](#3-use-clear-action-oriented-instructions)\\n\\nStart your AI prompts with strong action verbs. Words like Generate, Summarize, or Translate give the model a clear directive, and help cut through the noise.\\n\\nAvoid soft openings like “Can you…” or “I need…”. These weaken the prompt’s intent and make it feel more like a suggestion than a command. Instead, treat your prompt like an instruction to a function: be direct, specific, and purposeful.\\n\\nThis kind of action-oriented language doesn’t just sound better, it actually works better. Many of the model’s training examples came from commands and task-based inputs, so prompts written that way tend to map more cleanly to what the model already understands.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    I need help understanding this paragraph.\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    Summarize this paragraph in natural language to explain it to a high school student.\\n\\n### 4. Guide the Model to Think Step-by-Step[](#4-guide-the-model-to-think-step-by-step)\\n\\nWhen your prompt involves a complex or multi-part task, don’t ask the model to jump straight to the answer. Instead, use [prompt chaining](/blog/prompt-chaining) or step by step guidance to help it think through the problem in stages.\\n\\nThis technique is known as Chain-of-Thought prompting. You’re asking the model to reason out loud before giving its final answer. It’s a simple tweak that can make a big difference, reducing hallucinated answers and encouraging deeper, more accurate responses.\\n\\nIt’s especially useful for complex tasks like logic-heavy prompts, coding challenges, analytical work, and decision-making tasks. Even if you just want a final answer, guiding the process often leads to higher-quality (and more explainable) results.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    What’s the best marketing strategy for our new product?\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    Let's think through this step-by-step:\\n    1. List the top 3 features or benefits of our new productivity app.\\n    2. Identify the primary target audience based on those features.\\n    3. Describe one or two marketing channels that would best reach that audience.\\n    4. Based on all of the above, recommend a simple marketing strategy tailored to this audience.\\n\\n### 5. Specify the Desired Output Format[](#5-specify-the-desired-output-format)\\n\\nLLMs don’t just need to know what to answer: they need to know how to answer. When you define the format you expect, the results get a whole lot better.\\n\\nWant a list? Say so. Need bullet points, a table, JSON, or a block of code? Spell it out. Clear formatting instructions help the model stay focused, avoid hallucinations, and produce outputs that are easier to read, and easier to use.\\n\\nThis matters even more when your output is going into a downstream tool or system. Consistency counts. You can even prime the model by showing the format before the content, setting the structure before it generates the response.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    List benefits of remote work.\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    List 3 key benefits of remote work in bullet points, with each point no longer than one sentence.\\n\\n### 6. Stay with Simple, Accessible Language[](#6-stay-with-simple-accessible-language)\\n\\nLLMs work best when your prompts are clear, direct, and easy to understand, just like any good API. If your wording is vague or overloaded with jargon, the model is more likely to misfire.\\n\\nSkip the slang, idioms, and fuzzy phrases unless they’re truly necessary, and if they are, define them clearly. Words like better, intuitive, or robust might mean something to you, but to the model, they’re open to interpretation.\\n\\nWrite your prompt like you’re explaining specific tasks to someone smart but unfamiliar with your field. The simpler the language, the easier it is for the model to build a clear mental map, and that leads to more consistent, reliable results.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    Write a robust, intuitive onboarding flow with all the bells and whistles.\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    Write a clear, step-by-step onboarding flow that explains the product’s core features in under 5 screens.\\n\\n### 7. Assign the Model a Role When Context Matters[](#7-assign-the-model-a-role-when-context-matters)\\n\\nLLMs tend to respond more accurately, and in the right tone, when you tell them who they’re supposed to be. Giving the model a role helps it adopt the right voice, vocabulary, and level of formality for the task.\\n\\nNeed a professional explanation for a client? Ask the model to act as a consultant. Writing a friendly support reply? Frame it as coming from a helpful rep. Roles help guide tone, audience awareness, and framing, all of which make the output more relevant and useful.\\n\\nSome argue that assigning a role doesn’t truly change the model, it just forces you to clarify what you actually want, which might be a valid reason it works so well.\\n\\nDon’t do this:\\n\\n    Explain how to use Git to someone new.\\n\\nInstead, do this:\\n\\n    You are a programming instructor teaching a beginner. Explain how to use Git for version control in simple, friendly language.\\n\\n## 4 Best Practices to Make Your Prompts Repeatably Good[](#4-best-practices-to-make-your-prompts-repeatably-good)\\n\\nAt small scale, writing better prompts can get you far. But once you’re shipping [LLM applications](/blog/llm-applications) to real users, with unpredictable inputs and evolving models, prompt quality alone won’t cut it.\\n\\nLLMs are inherently non-deterministic since the same prompt can yield different outputs. So the question becomes not “how do I write the perfect prompt?” but “how do I engineer this system, including [LLM integration](/blog/llm-integration), to deliver reliable results?”\\n\\nThat makes prompt engineering a process of continuous improvement, what machine learning developers would call an optimization problem.\\n\\nSolving it means tracking *everything* that changes, measuring what works, and testing new ideas against old ones in your artificial intelligence systems. It’s no longer just about the prompt, but the entire system: inputs, outputs, and the code connecting them. In other words, effective [LLM orchestration](/blog/llm-orchestration).\\n\\nThe four best practices below approach prompt engineering as a system-level discipline that you version, trace, and improve over time.\\n\\n**We built Lilypad with this in mind**. While other platforms focus on narrow slices, like playgrounds or prompt versioning, they often fall short when it comes to implementing prompt engineering techniques that make LLM behavior repeatable at scale.\\n\\nFor example, such tools version the prompt but ignore things like parameters or helper logic. Others silo tracing and evaluation, forcing constant context-switching just to label or compare outputs.\\n\\nLilypad brings it all together. In the best practices for prompt engineering that follow, we’ll show how it helps teams apply real engineering principles to prompt development and make outputs reliably good.\\n\\n### 8. Version Everything that Influences the Output[](#8-version-everything-that-influences-the-output)\\n\\nIf it affects the LLM’s behavior, it should be versioned. Not just the prompt, but the model, temperature, helper functions, preprocessing steps, and surrounding logic.\\n\\nWithout versioning, you can’t reproduce outputs or track what changed. That’s why prompt engineering should follow the same rules as production code: every change to logic or inputs should create a new version.\\n\\nVersioning gives you visibility. It lets you roll back, track progress, and understand exactly what changed when results shift.\\n\\nLilypad makes this easy by versioning the full context; not just the prompt, but the code that shapes the call. In fact, we recommend wrapping every LLM call in a Python function to capture the model, parameters, prompt, and any pre/post-processing in one place, even when working with multi-step patterns like [LLM chaining](/blog/llm-chaining).\\n\\nAdd the `@lilypad.trace` decorator and set `versioning=automatic` to have Lilypad version every change made within the function closure.\\n\\n    import lilypad\\n    import os\\n    from openai import OpenAI\\n\\n    lilypad.configure(auto_llm=True)  \\n\\n    client = OpenAI()\\n\\n    @lilypad.trace(versioning=\\\"automatic\\\")  \\n    def answer_question(question: str) -> str:\\n        completion = client.chat.completions.create(\\n            model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\n            messages=[{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": question}],\\n        )\\n        return str(completion.choices[0].message.content)\\n\\n    response = answer_question(\\\"What makes popcorn pop?\\\")  \\n    print(response)\\n\\nThis shifts your workflow from ad hoc prompt tweaking to a structured, iterative process. The function now becomes a unit of optimization, something you can version, evaluate, and refine over time, much like a machine learning model.\\n\\nYou’re no longer asking, “Did this prompt change help?” You’re comparing, “Did version 4 outperform version 3 on our eval set?” Each time that function runs, whether in dev, staging, or production, Lilypad captures the full generation: it can break down the inputs, model responses, parameters, and the exact version of the code that produced it. That data flows straight into the Lilypad playground.\\n\\nThe playground is a collaborative prompt engineering environment where you evaluate and compare results. You can:\\n\\n- View outputs across different versions\\n- Inspect inputs and parameters for every call\\n- Swap between model or prompt versions to see how behavior changes\\n- Annotate outputs with pass/fail labels or notes\\n- Replay generations to test reproducibility or debug edge cases\\n\\n\\nInstead of guessing what changed (or why) you get a full trace, backed by version history and real inputs.\\n\\nFor example, we see below that V6 of our code calls `gpt-4o`:\\n\\n![Lilypad Answer Question v6 Trace](/assets/blog/prompt-engineering-best-practices/lilypad-answer-question-v6-trace.webp)\\n\\nChanging the model type automatically increments the version number:\\n\\n![Lilypad Answer Question v7 Trace](/assets/blog/prompt-engineering-best-practices/lilypad-answer-question-v7-trace.webp)\\n\\n### 9. Trace Every Output You Generate[](#9-trace-every-output-you-generate)\\n\\nTracing is how you observe what the model actually did, given a specific input, set of parameters, and version of your code.\\n\\nA good trace captures everything that matters: inputs, outputs, model settings, token usage, latency, cost, and more. When something breaks or performance drops, traces let you debug the issue instead of guessing. Observability isn’t optional. It’s foundational to building reliable LLM-powered apps, especially in production.\\n\\nThat’s why we recommend to trace not just raw API calls, but also the structured execution of your LLM-powered functions. You want to know not only *what* happened, but where it happened, and why.\\n\\nThat’s where Lilypad’s tracing system comes in. Just call `lilypad.configure()` to enable automatic tracing. This captures raw LLM API calls and logs critical metadata like inputs, outputs, token usage, and costs, giving you an API-level footprint of your versioned calls.\\n\\n![Lilypad Traces Tab](/assets/blog/prompt-engineering-best-practices/lilypad-traces-tab.webp)\\n\\nBut to make those traces truly actionable, the `@lilypad.trace` decorator promotes each trace from a loose log to a structured unit of execution, linking it directly to the function that made the call, like `answer_question()` in our earlier example. That lets you filter, group, and analyze traces by logical units, not just endpoints or paths.\\n\\n![Lilypad Nested OpenTelemetry Span](/assets/blog/prompt-engineering-best-practices/lilypad-nested-otel-span.webp)\\n\\n### 10. Offer Safe and Controlled Prompt Collaboration[](#10-offer-safe-and-controlled-prompt-collaboration)\\n\\nPrompt tuning shouldn't be limited to engineers. Product managers, writers, and domain experts often bring the kind of insight that makes or breaks how you write prompts, especially when tone, clarity, or context really matter.\\n\\nThat means you need a way to let non-developers contribute without touching production code.\\n\\nWith Lilypad, you can do exactly that. It supports managed prompts, which are versioned prompt templates that live in the playground. This lets contributors edit, test, and iterate on prompts directly in the browser, while developers reference those prompts safely in code, without ever needing to redeploy the app just to apply a wording tweak.\\n\\n![Lilypad Playground](/assets/blog/prompt-engineering-best-practices/lilypad-playground.webp)\\n\\nThis creates a clean separation of concerns: developers handle infrastructure and application logic, while subject matter experts own the prompt wording. This division is especially valuable when collaborating on more advanced use cases, such as [LLM agents](/blog/llm-agents), where prompt components and control logic need to evolve independently.\\n\\nEach team can move quickly without blocking or breaking the other, improving the user experience. And because the playground features prompts that are markdown-enabled and fully versioned, collaborators can experiment freely, revert changes, and keep improving without risk.\\n\\nBut make no mistake: an [LLM prompt](/blog/llm-prompt) isn’t a floating artifact detached from your codebase. Under the hood, Lilypad treats them just like any other function. The playground generates type-safe code that matches the prompt version you’re referencing in production.\\n\\nIf Lilypad ever goes offline, your code keeps running as-is, with no hidden dependencies, no broken links.\\n\\nThis contrasts with many other systems, which treat prompts as separate from code entirely. That kind of separation might seem flexible, but it makes your system brittle. When the logic that drives model behavior lives outside your source of truth, it’s harder to test, debug, or trust what’s actually going into production.\\n\\n### 11. Make Evals a First-Class Citizen[](#11-make-evals-a-first-class-citizen)\\n\\nWithout evaluation, you’re running without feedback. You can’t know whether a prompt change improved performance, introduced regressions, or simply altered behavior in unpredictable ways.\\n\\n[LLM evaluation](/blog/llm-evaluation) shouldn’t be an afterthought, but should be a core part of your development workflow. A practical place to start is with binary labels: pass/fail, accompanied by a brief explanation. This approach is faster to apply, easier to interpret, and more consistent than numeric scoring systems.\\n\\nBy contrast, ratings like 1–5 often suffer from ambiguity. What distinguishes a “4” from a “5”? Without clear criteria, such scores quickly become subjective and inconsistent, even across reviews from the same person.\\n\\nPass/fail evaluations avoid that ambiguity and better reflect real-world needs. They align with the core question most teams care about: is this output good enough to deploy?\\n\\nThis structure also lends itself to automation. Once you’ve built a solid evaluation dataset, some [LLM tools](/blog/llm-tools) allow you to prompt an LLM to act as a judge, replicating the behavior of human evaluators. That said, [LLM-as-a-judge](/blog/llm-as-judge) outputs should still be verified by humans, especially when dealing with edge cases where outputs may be difficult to assess.\\n\\nLilypad makes evaluation easy to adopt. Non-technical contributors can annotate outputs from AI tools directly in the playground UI: selecting pass or fail and providing reasoning with just a few clicks.\\n\\n![Lilypad Annotation Queue](/assets/blog/prompt-engineering-best-practices/lilypad-annotation-queue.webp)\\n\\nEach evaluation is tied to a specific version of the function that generated the model outputs. That means when quality shifts, whether for better or worse, you can immediately trace back to what changed: the prompt, model, code, parameters, or any combination of the above.\\n\\n## Go Beyond Prompt Writing, Start Prompt Engineering[](#go-beyond-prompt-writing-start-prompt-engineering)\\n\\nBuild with the same rigor you apply to the rest of your stack: Lilypad brings versioning, observability, and [prompt evaluation](/blog/prompt-evaluation) to every call made to AI models to help ensure desired outcomes.\\n\\n[To get started with Lilypad](https://lilypad.mirascope.com/), you can use your GitHub credentials to sign up and begin tracing and versioning your LLM functions with just a few lines of code.\\n\\n========================\\n## Getting Started with Function Calling[](#getting-started-with-function-calling)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0I-hwZSWMs?si=tQgi-LiHe6Oj_rzm](https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0I-hwZSWMs?si=tQgi-LiHe6Oj_rzm)\\n\\nFunction calling is the ability to reliably connect LLMs to external tools to enable effective tool usage and interaction with external APIs.\\n\\nLLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have been fine-tuned to detect when a function needs to be called and then output JSON containing arguments to call the function. The functions that are being called by function calling will act as tools in your AI application and you can define more than one in a single request.\\n\\nFunction calling is an important ability for building LLM-powered chatbots or agents that need to retrieve context for an LLM or interact with external tools by converting natural language into API calls.\\n\\nFunctional calling enables developers to create:\\n\\n- conversational agents that can efficiently use external tools to answer questions. For example, the query \\\"What is the weather like in Belize?\\\" will be converted to a function call such as `get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')`\\n- LLM-powered solutions for extracting and tagging data (e.g., extracting people names from a Wikipedia article)\\n- applications that can help convert natural language to API calls or valid database queries\\n- conversational knowledge retrieval engines that interact with a knowledge base\\n\\n\\nIn this guide, we demonstrate how to prompt models like GPT-4 and open-source models to perform function calling for different use cases.\\n\\n## Function Calling with GPT-4[](#function-calling-with-gpt-4)\\n\\nAs a basic example, let's say we asked the model to check the weather in a given location.\\n\\nThe LLM alone would not be able to respond to this request because it has been trained on a dataset with a cutoff point. The way to solve this is to combine the LLM with an external tool. You can leverage the function calling capabilities of the model to determine an external function to call along with its arguments and then have it return a final response. Below is a simple example of how you can achieve this using the OpenAI APIs.\\n\\nLet's say a user is asking the following question to the model:\\n\\nTo handle this request using function calling, the first step is to define a weather function or set of functions that you will be passing as part of the OpenAI API request:\\n\\nThe `get_current_weather` function returns the current weather in a given location. When you pass this function definition as part of the request, it doesn't actually executes a function, it just returns a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call the function. Here are some code snippets of how to achieve this.\\n\\nYou can define a completion function as follows:\\n\\nThis is how you can compose the user question:\\n\\nFinally, you can call the `get_completion` above and passing both the `messages` and `tools`:\\n\\nThe `response` object contains the following:\\n\\nIn particular, the `arguments` object contains the important arguments extracted by the model and that will be needed to complete the request.\\n\\nYou can then choose to call an external weather API for the actual weather. Once you have the weather information available you can pass it back to the model to summarize a final response given the original user question.\\n\\n## Notebooks[](#notebooks)\\n\\nHere is a notebook with a simple example that demonstrates how to use function calling with the OpenAI APIs:\\n\\n## Function Calling with Open-Source LLMs[](#function-calling-with-open-source-llms)\\n\\nMore notes on function calling with open-source LLMs coming soon.\\n\\n## Function Calling Use Cases[](#function-calling-use-cases)\\n\\nBelow is a list of use cases that can benefit from the function calling capability of LLMs:\\n\\n- **Conversational Agents**: Function calling can be used to create complex conversational agents or chatbots that answer complex questions by calling external APIs or external knowledge base and providing more relevant and useful responses.\\n\\n- **Natural Language Understanding**: It can convert natural language into structured JSON data, extract structured data from text, and perform tasks like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.\\n\\n- **Math Problem Solving**: Function calling can be used to define custom functions to solve complex mathematical problems that require multiple steps and different types of advanced calculations.\\n\\n- **API Integration**: It can be used to effectively integrate LLMs with external APIs to fetch data or perform actions based on the input. This could be helpful to build either a QA system or creative assistant. In general, function calling can convert natural language into valid API calls.\\n\\n- **Information Extraction**: Function calling be effectively used to extract specific information from a given input, such as retrieving relevant news stories or references from an article.\\n\\n## References[](#references)\\n\\n- [Fireworks Raises the Quality Bar with Function Calling Model and API Release (opens in a new tab)](https://blog.fireworks.ai/fireworks-raises-the-quality-bar-with-function-calling-model-and-api-release-e7f49d1e98e9)\\n- [Benchmarking Agent Tool Use and Function Calling (opens in a new tab)](https://blog.langchain.dev/benchmarking-agent-tool-use/)\\n- [Function Calling (opens in a new tab)](https://ai.google.dev/docs/function_calling)\\n- [Interacting with APIs (opens in a new tab)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/apis)\\n- [OpenAI's Function Calling (opens in a new tab)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)\\n- [How to call functions with chat models (opens in a new tab)](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models)\\n- [Pushing ChatGPT's Structured Data Support To Its Limits (opens in a new tab)](https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/)\\n- [Math Problem Solving with Function Calling (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/svpino/openai-function-calling/blob/main/sample.ipynb)\\n\\n\\nLast updated on Sat Dec 20 2025\\n\\nSponsored by[![SerpAPI](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/docs/logos/serpapi.png)](https://serpapi.com/)\\n\\n[![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBmaWxsPSJub25lIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQgMjQiIHN0cm9rZT0iY3VycmVudENvbG9yIj48cGF0aCBzdHJva2Utd2lkdGg9IjIiIHN0cm9rZS1saW5lY2FwPSJyb3VuZCIgc3Ryb2tlLWxpbmVqb2luPSJyb3VuZCIgZD0iTTkgNWw3IDctNyA3IiAvPjwvc3ZnPg==)Fine-tuning GPT-4o](/applications/finetuning-gpt4o \\\"Fine-tuning GPT-4o\\\")[Context Caching with LLMs![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBmaWxsPSJub25lIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQgMjQiIHN0cm9rZT0iY3VycmVudENvbG9yIj48cGF0aCBzdHJva2UtbGluZWNhcD0icm91bmQiIGQ9Ik05IDVsNyA3LTcgNyIgc3Ryb2tlLWxpbmVqb2luPSJyb3VuZCIgc3Ryb2tlLXdpZHRoPSIyIiAvPjwvc3ZnPg==)](/applications/context-caching \\\"Context Caching with LLMs\\\")\\n\\n========================\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, but to get high-quality, useful output, creating effective prompts is crucial. The quality of the generated code is heavily dependent on the quality of the prompts provided. A poorly framed prompt can lead to incomplete, incorrect, or generic responses, whereas a well-structured prompt maximizes the model’s potential. In this article, we will explore advanced strategies for writing effective prompts to generate high-quality code with LLMs.\\n\\n## Provide Detailed Context\\n\\n[](#provide-detailed-context)\\n\\nWhen interacting with LLMs for code generation, the depth and quality of context provided directly correlates with the relevance and accuracy of the output.\\n\\nKey elements to include:\\n\\n- Specific problem domain\\n- Existing codebase characteristics\\n- Implementation constraints\\n- Performance requirements\\n- Architectural patterns already in use\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, you can use *@references* to point the model to specific files or functions, making your request more precise. Instead of describing a function in text, you can directly reference it.\\n\\n    ❌ Poor: \\\"Create a user authentication system.\\\"\\n\\n    ✅ Better: \\\"Create a JWT-based authentication system for a Node.js Express API that integrates with our MongoDB user collection. The system should handle password hashing with bcrypt, issue tokens valid for 24 hours, and implement refresh token rotation for security. Our existing middleware pattern uses async/await syntax. Refer to @authMiddleware.js for the middleware structure and @userModel.js for the user schema.\\\"\\n\\nBy using *@authMiddleware.js* and *@userModel.js*, you ensure the generated code aligns with your existing setup, reducing integration issues and manual adjustments.\\n\\n## Break Down Problems Into Steps\\n\\n[](#break-down-problems-into-steps)\\n\\nComplex coding tasks require systematic decomposition into manageable units. This approach begins with:\\n\\n- Start with clear functionality requirements\\n- Analyze directory structure and code organization\\n- Guide the LLM through logical implementation steps for the desired functionality while respecting established architectural boundaries and design patterns.\\n\\n\\nFor instance, when implementing a data processing pipeline, first clarify the input data structure, transformation logic, error handling requirements, and expected output format. Next, analyze the directory structure and determine where the new functionality should be implemented.\\n\\nConsider factors such as dependency relationships, module boundaries, and code organization principles. This step ensures that generated code will integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.\\n\\n## Choose the Correct Model for the Job\\n\\n[](#choose-the-correct-model-for-the-job)\\n\\nDifferent LLMs exhibit varying strengths in code generation tasks. One model may excel at understanding complex requirements and generating code with strong logical consistency, while another model may offer advantages in certain programming languages or frameworks. When evaluating which LLM to use, key technical factors to consider:\\n\\n- Context window capacity (essential when working with extensive codebases)\\n- Language/framework proficiency\\n- Domain-specific knowledge\\n- Consistency across iterations\\n\\n\\nExample comparison:\\n\\n| Task | Model Selection Consideration |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Complex enterprise architecture | Models with larger context windows excel at maintaining consistency across large codebases |\\n| ML pipeline implementation | Models with stronger mathematics and data science training perform better |\\n| Frontend component generation | Models with recent training on modern frameworks provide up-to-date patterns |\\n\\n\\n## Be Specific When Referring to Existing Patterns\\n\\n[](#be-specific-when-referring-to-existing-patterns)\\n\\nSpecificity in prompts significantly improves code quality by eliminating uncertainity. Technical specificity involves explicit references to existing implementation patterns. Rather than requesting generic implementations, point to specific reference points in the codebase. For example:\\n\\n    ❌ Poor: \\\"Write a function to process user data.\\\"\\n\\n    ✅ Better: \\\"Create a new method in the UserProcessor class (src/services/UserProcessor.js) that transforms user data following the same functional approach used in the transformPaymentData method. Prioritize readability over performance as this runs asynchronously.\\\"\\n\\nThis approach extends to naming conventions, coding standards, and architectural patterns. Specify whether the code should follow functional or object-oriented methodologies, indicate preferred design patterns, and clarify whether performance or readability should be prioritized.\\n\\n## Regenerate Rather Than Rollback\\n\\n[](#regenerate-rather-than-rollback)\\n\\nWhen encountering issues with generated code, complete regeneration of the problematic parts often gives us much better results compared to incremental fixes. This method originates from how LLMs interpret context and produce responses.\\n\\nWhy regeneration works better?\\n\\n- Provides fresh perspective without previous errors\\n- Avoids propagating flawed logic\\n- Allows incorporation of new constraints\\n\\n\\nThis technique is particularly effective for algorithmic challenges or complex logic implementations where small errors can propagate throughout the solution, making isolated fixes problematic.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    \\\"Let's try a different approach for the sorting algorithm. The previous implementation had O(n²) complexity, which won't work for our dataset size. Please regenerate the solution focusing on an O(n log n) approach using a merge sort pattern similar to what we use in our other data processing functions.\\\"\\n\\n## Implement Reflection Through Multiple Approaches\\n\\n[](#implement-reflection-through-multiple-approaches)\\n\\nLeveraging LLMs' ability to generate multiple solution approaches enhances code quality through comparative analysis. Begin by requesting the model to generate two or three distinct implementation strategies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nOnce multiple approaches are generated, prompt the LLM to analyze the trade-offs between them considering factors such as time complexity, space efficiency, readability, and maintainability. This reflection process enables the model to select and refine the most appropriate solution based on the specific requirements.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    \\\"Generate three different approaches to implement a caching system for our API responses:\\n\\n    1. An in-memory LRU cache using a custom data structure\\n    2. A Redis-based distributed cache solution\\n    3. A file-system based approach with TTL\\n\\n    For each approach, analyze time complexity, memory usage, scalability across multiple servers, and implementation complexity.\\\"\\n\\n## Implement Self-Review Mechanisms\\n\\n[](#implement-self-review-mechanisms)\\n\\nSelf-review prompting enhances code quality by guiding the LLM through a systematic evaluation of its output. Implement this by explicitly requesting the model to cross-check its generated code after completion. The review should assess aspects such as:\\n\\n- Correctness (logical errors)\\n- Efficiency (performance issues)\\n- Edge case handling\\n- Security vulnerabilities\\n- Adherence to requirements\\n\\n\\nDuring self-review, the model can identify potential issues such as race conditions in concurrent code, memory leaks in resource management, or vulnerability points in security-critical sections. Once issues are identified, the model can immediately refine the implementation to address these concerns. This approach mirrors established software engineering practices like code review and static analysis, but performs them within the same prompt-response cycle, significantly improving the initial code quality.\\n\\n## Give the Model a Persona or Frame of Reference\\n\\n[](#give-the-model-a-persona-or-frame-of-reference)\\n\\nAssigning a technical persona to the LLM establishes a consistent perspective for code generation. When prompted to adopt the mindset of a senior backend engineer with expertise in distributed systems, the model will prioritize scalability, fault tolerance, and performance considerations in its generated code. Similarly, a security-focused persona will emphasize input validation, proper authentication flows, and potential vulnerability mitigation.\\n\\nThe technical frame of reference should match the requirements of the task.\\n\\nEffective personas by task:\\n\\n- Backend systems: \\\"Senior backend engineer with distributed systems expertise\\\"\\n- Security features: \\\"Security architect with OWASP expertise\\\"\\n- Infrastructure: \\\"DevOps engineer focusing on cloud-native solutions\\\"\\n- Frontend: \\\"UX-focused frontend developer with accessibility expertise\\\"\\n\\n\\nThis technique leverages the model's ability to imitate domain expertise, resulting in code that better reflects established practices within specific technical domains.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    \\\"Act as a senior security engineer conducting a code review. Create a user registration system in Python/Django that implements proper password handling, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.\\\"\\n\\n## Clarify Language, Framework, or Library Constraints\\n\\n[](#clarify-language-framework-or-library-constraints)\\n\\nExplicit specification of technical constraints ensures compatibility with the target environment. Begin by clearly stating the programming language version (e.g., Python 3.9, TypeScript 4.5) to ensure language features used in the generated code are available in the production environment. Similarly, specify framework versions and their specific conventions, such as \\\"FastAPI 0.95 with Pydantic v2 for data validation.\\\"\\n\\nAdditionally, provide information about library dependencies and their integration points. For instance, when requesting database interaction code, specify whether to use an ORM like SQLAlchemy or raw SQL queries, and clarify connection handling expectations. This level of specificity prevents the generation of code that relies on unavailable dependencies or incompatible versions.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    \\\"Generate a REST API endpoint using:\\n\\n    - Python 3.9\\n    - FastAPI 0.95 with Pydantic v2 models\\n    - SQLAlchemy 2.0 for database queries\\n    - JWT authentication using our existing AuthManager from auth_utils.py\\n    - Must be compatible with our PostgreSQL 13 database\\\"\\n\\n## Implement Chain of Thought Prompting\\n\\n[](#implement-chain-of-thought-prompting)\\n\\nChain of thought prompting enhances code generation by guiding the LLM through a logical progression of reasoning steps. This technique involves instructing the model to decompose complex problems into sequential reasoning stages before writing code.\\n\\nSequential reasoning stages to request:\\n\\n- Initial explanation of the conceptual approach\\n- Pseudocode outline of the solution\\n- Implementation details for each component\\n- Complete integrated implementation\\n\\n\\nChain of thought prompting is effective for algorithms with complex logic or data transformations. It reduces logical errors, improves coherence, and offers visibility into the model's reasoning, allowing for corrections before the final code is produced.\\n\\nUnlike the \\\"break down into steps\\\" approach, which focuses on task decomposition, chain of thought prompting emphasizes making the model's reasoning explicit, helping ensure the logic is sound before accepting the final solution.\\n\\n## Tailor Prompts to the Model's Unique Strengths\\n\\n[](#tailor-prompts-to-the-models-unique-strengths)\\n\\nDifferent LLMs exhibit varying capabilities that can be leveraged through specialized prompting strategies.\\n\\nAdaptation strategies:\\n\\n- For limited context windows: Focus on algorithmic guidance\\n- For strong functional programming models: Frame problems using functional patterns\\n- For models with framework expertise: Leverage specific framework terminology\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding a model's training biases also informs effective prompting. Some models may excel at particular programming paradigms or languages based on their training data distribution. For instance, a model with strong representation of functional programming concepts in its training data will respond better to prompts framed in functional terms for appropriate problems.\\n\\n## Specify Edge Cases and Constraints\\n\\n[](#specify-edge-cases-and-constraints)\\n\\nComprehensive edge case consideration significantly improves code robustness. Technical edge cases vary by domain but commonly include boundary values, resource limitations, and exceptional conditions. When requesting implementations, clearly list these factors, for instance, specifying how a data processing function should handle empty inputs, malformed data, or values exceeding expected ranges.\\n\\nBy considering these constraints upfront, the generated code can incorporate appropriate validation logic, error handling mechanisms, and performance optimizations tailored to the specified limitations.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    \\\"Implement a file processing function that handles:\\n\\n    - Empty files (return empty result)\\n    - Files exceeding 1GB (process in chunks)\\n    - Malformed CSV data (log error, continue processing valid rows)\\n    - Concurrent access (implement appropriate locking)\\n    - Network interruptions (implement resume capability)\\\"\\n\\nMastering prompt engineering for code generation is both an art and a science that dramatically improves development efficiency. By implementing these strategic approaches, developers can transform LLMs from basic code generators into sophisticated development partners, enabling the creation of more robust, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.\\n\\n========================\\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), effective prompt engineering has become a crucial skill. While much attention is given to the art of crafting effective prompts, less focus has been placed on how to efficiently manage these prompts programmatically. Python, with its rich set of built-in features, offers powerful tools to dynamically construct, optimize, and manage LLM prompts.  \\nThis article explores how Python's built-in features can transform your approach to LLM prompt engineering, making your code more efficient, maintainable, and powerful.\\n\\n## [#1-using-locals-for-dynamic-context-injection](#1-using-locals-for-dynamic-context-injection)**1. Using locals() for Dynamic Context Injection**\\n\\n**The Problem**  \\nWhen working with LLMs, we often need to inject contextual information into our prompts.

The techniques in this article can help you move beyond static prompt templates to create truly adaptive and context-aware LLM applications.  \\nMost importantly, these approaches scale well as your LLM applications become more complex, allowing you to maintain clean, readable code while supporting sophisticated prompt engineering techniques.  \\nWhether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex AI assistant, Python's built-in features can help you create more effective LLM interactions with less code and fewer errors.\\n\\n========================\\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, it sparked an immediate rush to figure out how to get the most out of these powerful new [language models](/resources/articles/large-language-models). The practice was quickly dubbed ”prompt engineering,” and with it came breathless predictions that “prompt engineer” would become the hottest job title of the decade. LinkedIn filled up with self-proclaimed experts, and rumors of six-figure salaries circulated widely. Fast forward to now, and that initial hype cycle has [cooled considerably](https://fortune.com/2025/05/07/prompt-engineering-200k-six-figure-role-now-obsolete-thanks-to-ai/).\\n\\nBut the underlying skill—crafting inputs that produce genuinely useful outputs—has only grown more important as AI tools have embedded themselves into real workflows. Whether you’re generating a quarterly analysis with [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5), producing product photos with Google’s [Nano Banana](/resources/articles/nano-banana) Pro, or debugging a complex function with [OpenAI’s Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/), the difference between a vague instruction and a well-crafted prompt may mean the difference between getting generic outputs and exactly what you need. Read on for prompt engineering best practices—from using few-shot examples to guide output format to breaking complex tasks into smaller steps—that will help you get useful results on the first try instead of the fifth.\\n\\n**Key takeaways**:\\n\\n- Prompt engineering is the process of writing and structuring inputs so large language models produce clearer, more accurate, and more useful responses for a given task.\\n\\n- Key techniques include zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, role or persona prompting, prompt chaining, meta-prompting, and reflection prompting to guide reasoning and output quality.\\n\\n- Prompt engineering best practices focus on being specific, providing clear context, examples, and data, defining the desired output, and giving instructions on what to do rather than what to avoid.\\n\\n- Strong results from LLMs come from iterating on prompts, testing variations, understanding model limitations, and refining inputs based on the quality and consistency of responses.\\n\\n## [What is prompt engineering?](#what-is-prompt-engineering)\\n\\nPrompt engineering is the process of carefully designing the inputs you give to large language models to get desired outputs. It includes word choice, how you order instructions, what context you provide, and whether you include examples. At a more advanced level, it means knowing when to use techniques like few-shot prompting—providing input-output pairs so the model learns your desired format—or chain-of-thought prompting, where you ask the model to reason step-by-step before delivering a final answer. And despite the name, prompt engineering isn’t just for engineers: it’s for anyone using [AI assistant tools](/resources/articles/claude-ai-alternative-assistants) like Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT who wants better results, whether you’re writing code or drafting social posts.\\n\\nWatch how to use prompting in Cursor with [DigitalOcean’s MCP server](https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/mcp-digitalocean) to build, deploy, update, and manage an [App Platform](/products/app-platform) React app using natural language instead of juggling terminals, dashboards, and scripts. Follow along as a simple React app goes from setup to live deployment and iteration entirely from within your editor.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpJjydsqvBA](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpJjydsqvBA)\\n\\n## [Why is prompt engineering important?](#why-is-prompt-engineering-important)\\n\\nAs models like Llama 4, [Grok 3](/resources/articles/grok-vs-chatgpt), and [DeepSeek-R1](/community/tutorials/deepseek-r1-large-language-model-capabilities) grow more capable, the quality of your input increasingly determines the quality of your output. In other words, how you phrase a request shapes what you get back. A poorly structured prompt may require multiple back-and-forth exchanges to clarify intent, whereas a thoughtfully engineered prompt yields usable results on the first (or second) attempt.\\n\\n- **It reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy**: Explicitly giving the model permission to say “I don’t know” when it lacks sufficient information makes it less likely to [hallucinate](/resources/articles/ai-hallucination) and fabricate answers. Providing relevant context and source material gives the model a factual foundation to work from, rather than relying solely on training data.\\n\\n- **It unlocks better performance for code generation**: When using tools like OpenAI’s [Codex CLI](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex/) or asking Claude to debug a script, prompts that include leading words like “import” or “SELECT” nudge the model toward the correct output pattern. Specifying the programming language, expected inputs and outputs, and edge cases to handle produces code that’s closer to production-ready.\\n\\n- **It makes complex reasoning more transparent and reliable**: Chain-of-thought prompting asks the model to reason step-by-step before delivering a final answer, which is especially valuable for multi-step math problems or analytical tasks. This technique surfaces the model’s logic so you spot errors mid-process rather than discovering them in the final output.\\n\\n- **It gives you control over output format and structure**: Few-shot prompting with input-output examples teaches the model the exact style, tone, or schema you’re looking for, whether that’s a [JSON](/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-json) object, a bulleted summary, or a formal report.\\n\\n- **It improves results for image generation and multimodal tasks**: When prompting image models like [DALL-E 3](/resources/articles/dall-e-alternatives) or [Midjourney](/resources/articles/midjourney-alternatives), specificity around lighting, composition, and style dramatically affects output quality. The same principle applies to [vision-language models](/community/tutorials/visualizing-vision-language-models-multimodal-reasoning): asking Claude to analyze a chart step-by-step in structured tags yields more accurate data extraction than a generic “describe this image” request.\\n\\n## [Types of prompting engineering techniques](#types-of-prompting-engineering-techniques)\\n\\nDifferent tasks call for different approaches. A simple question might need nothing more than a clear instruction, while a multi-step analysis might require examples, [structured reasoning](/community/tutorials/understanding-reasoning-in-llms), or breaking the work into stages. The techniques below range from basic to advanced, and they can (and should) be combined depending on what you’re trying to accomplish.\\n\\n| Technique | What it does | Best for | Example use case |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Zero-shot | Direct instruction with no examples | Simple, well-defined tasks | “Translate this sentence to French” |\\n| Few-shot | Provides input-output examples before the request | Format-sensitive or style-specific outputs | Teaching the model your preferred summary format |\\n| Chain-of-thought | Asks the model to reason step-by-step | Math, logic, and multi-step analysis | Walking through a word problem before answering |\\n| Tree-of-thought | Explores multiple reasoning paths before selecting the best one | Complex problems requiring strategic planning | Solving puzzles or multi-step decisions with backtracking |\\n| Role or persona | Assigns the model an identity or expertise | Domain-specific tasks requiring a particular tone | “You are a senior Python developer reviewing this code” |\\n| Prompt chaining | Breaks complex tasks into sequential prompts | Multi-stage workflows with dependencies | Summarize → critique → revise |\\n| Meta-prompting | Uses an LLM to generate or improve prompts | Optimizing prompts at scale or for reusable templates | Having a model refine your summarization prompt |\\n| Reflection prompting | Asks the model to critique and refine its own output | Catching errors and improving accuracy | “Review your answer for mistakes and correct them” |\\n\\n### [Zero-shot prompting](#zero-shot-prompting)\\n\\nZero-shot prompting is the most straightforward approach: you give the model a direct instruction without any examples. This works well when the task is clear, and the expected output format is obvious, like asking “What’s the capital of Japan?” or “Summarize this paragraph in two sentences.” The model relies entirely on its training to interpret what you want. Zero-shot is fast and requires minimal setup, but it falls short when you need a specific structure, tone, or style that isn’t implicit in the instruction itself.\\n\\n### [Few-shot prompting](#few-shot-prompting)\\n\\nFew-shot prompting provides one or more input-output examples before your actual request, helping the model learn the pattern you’re looking for. For instance, if you want summaries in a specific format, you might show two examples of articles paired with your preferred summary style, then ask the model to summarize a third article the same way. This technique is especially useful when the desired output involves subtle formatting, tone, or conventions that are hard to describe in words alone, or when your data involves multiple different categorizations or classifications that benefit from clarification. Start with one example (one-shot), then add more if the output still isn’t matching your expectations.\\n\\nMaster [few-shot prompting](/community/tutorials/_few-shot-prompting-techniques-examples-best-practices) by providing input-output examples that teach LLMs to recognize patterns without fine-tuning. Learn when to use zero-shot vs. few-shot approaches, plus implementation techniques with the OpenAI API and LangChain.\\n\\n### [Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](#chain-of-thought-cot-prompting)\\n\\nChain-of-thought prompting asks the model to show its reasoning before delivering a final answer. The simplest version is adding “Think step-by-step” to your prompt, which encourages the model to work through the problem rather than jumping straight to a conclusion. For example, instead of asking “What’s 15% of 340?” you might prompt: “Calculate 15% of 340. Show your work step-by-step, then give the final answer.”\\n\\nThis technique shines when it comes to math problems, logic puzzles, and analytical tasks where intermediate steps matter. It also makes errors easier to spot—if the model’s reasoning goes wrong at step two, you get to catch it before it compounds into a bad final answer. Some models, like [Claude’s extended thinking mode](https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking), automate this process, but manual CoT remains valuable when you need transparent, reviewable logic.\\n\\n### [Tree-of-thought (ToT) prompting](#tree-of-thought-tot-prompting)\\n\\nTree-of-thought prompting extends chain-of-thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously rather than following a single chain. Instead of committing to one line of reasoning, the model generates several possible approaches, evaluates each one, and backtracks if a path isn’t working—similar to how humans solve complex problems through trial and error.\\n\\nThis technique is especially useful for tasks that require strategic planning, like game-playing or multi-step decisions, where an early wrong choice may derail the entire solution. ToT is more resource-intensive than simpler methods and is typically overkill for straightforward tasks, but it outperforms other techniques on problems that benefit from deliberate exploration and self-evaluation. A [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601) conducted by researchers at Princeton and Google DeepMind found that tree-of-thought prompting achieved a 74% success rate on the Game of 24 benchmark—a math puzzle using four numbers to reach 24. This result was much higher than chain-of-thought (49%) and standard input-output prompting (33%)—but at a higher cost per case ($0.74 vs. $0.47 and $0.13).\\n\\n### [Role or persona prompting](#role-or-persona-prompting)\\n\\nRole prompting assigns the model a specific identity, expertise, or perspective to shape the scope of how it responds. A prompt like “You are an experienced immigration attorney” will produce a different answer than “You are a travel blogger” when asked about visa requirements—the attorney focuses on legal accuracy, while the blogger might emphasize practical tips. This technique is useful when you need domain-specific vocabulary, a particular communication style, or responses calibrated to a certain audience.\\n\\nThat said, modern models are sophisticated enough that heavy-handed role assignments (“You are a world-renowned expert who never makes mistakes”) may actually backfire by limiting helpfulness. A lighter touch often works better: instead of assigning a role, try being explicit about the perspective you want, like “Analyze this investment portfolio with a focus on risk tolerance and long-term growth.”\\n\\n### [Prompt chaining](#prompt-chaining)\\n\\nPrompt chaining breaks a complex task into smaller sequential steps, where the output of one prompt becomes the input for the next. Rather than asking a model to “research this topic, outline an article, write the draft, and edit it for tone” in a single prompt, you’d handle each stage separately: first generate research notes, then feed those into an outline prompt, then expand the outline into a draft, and finally run an editing pass. This approach trades speed for accuracy—each individual prompt is easier for the model to execute well, and you get to review or adjust the output at each stage before moving on.\\n\\nPrompt chaining is particularly effective for workflows that involve analysis followed by synthesis, like summarizing a document, grading the summary for completeness, then improving it based on that feedback. It’s typically implemented programmatically via API or AI workflow tools, but you can also do it manually in a chat interface by copying outputs between prompts. The manual approach gives you human-in-the-loop control over complex workflows, letting you apply your own judgment and make adjustments between steps.\\n\\n### [Meta-prompting](#meta-prompting)\\n\\nMeta-prompting uses an LLM to generate, refine, or improve prompts rather than writing them yourself from scratch. Instead of crafting every detail manually, you provide a high-level description of what you want and let the model propose an improved version—or you use a more capable model to optimize prompts for a less capable one.\\n\\nThis technique is useful when you need reusable prompt templates, want to systematically improve prompts across a category of tasks, or are building applications where prompt quality directly impacts results at scale. Tools like [ChatPRD](https://www.chatprd.ai/) are built around this idea—they take your high-level product concepts and turn them into structured prompts that AI can use to generate apps or features. Meta-prompting lets you work at the level of what you want rather than getting bogged down in the exact phrasing needed to make AI understand it.\\n\\n### [Reflection prompting](#reflection-prompting)\\n\\nReflection prompting asks the model to critique, evaluate, or refine its own output before delivering a final answer. After generating an initial response, you prompt the model to review its work—checking for errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement—and then produce a revised version based on that self-assessment.\\n\\nUse this approach for tasks where accuracy matters and a second pass catches mistakes that slipped through the first attempt. For example, after generating code, you might prompt: “Review the code above for bugs or edge cases, then provide a corrected version.” Reflection adds [latency](/resources/articles/network-latency) since it requires additional processing, but it often improves output quality on complex reasoning, writing, and problem-solving tasks.\\n\\n## [10 prompt engineering best practices](#10-prompt-engineering-best-practices)\\n\\nWhether you’re generating code, drafting marketing copy, analyzing data, or building automated workflows, the following practices apply across use cases and prompting techniques. Think of them as universal habits that make any prompt more effective—regardless of the specific model you’re using or what you’re trying to accomplish.\\n\\nChallenge yourself with a fun image prompt guessing game that reveals how specific wording guides generative results, sharpening your understanding of effective prompting. See how small changes in phrasing influence outputs and build intuition for prompt design with hands-on feedback.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kfzr6wR8LNs](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kfzr6wR8LNs)\\n\\n### [1. Be as specific as possible](#1-be-as-specific-as-possible)\\n\\nSpecificity is key to obtaining the most accurate and relevant information from an AI when writing prompts. A specific prompt minimizes ambiguity, allowing the AI to understand the request’s context and nuance, preventing it from providing overly broad or unrelated responses. To achieve this, include as many relevant details as possible without overloading the AI with superfluous information so context stays focused. This balance ensures that the AI has just enough guidance to produce the specific outcome you’re aiming for.\\n\\nWhen creating the best prompts for an AI, ask for the following specifics:\\n\\n- **Detailed context**: Provide the AI with enough background information to understand the scenario you’re inquiring about. This includes the subject matter, scope, and any relevant constraints.\\n\\n- **Desired format**: Clearly specify the format in which you want the information to be presented, whether it’s a list, a detailed report, bullet points, or a summary. Mention any structural preferences, such as headings, subheadings, or paragraph limits.\\n\\n- **Output length**: Detail how long you want the AI’s response, whether that’s “3 paragraphs” or “250 words.”\\n\\n- **Level of detail**: Indicate the level of detail required for the response, from high-level overviews to in-depth analysis, to ensure the model’s output matches your informational needs. For example, “Give me a five-sentence summary of this report” will produce a very different output than “Walk me through each section of this report and explain the key findings in detail.”\\n\\n- **Tone and style**: A prompt asking for “a professional summary for stakeholders” will produce something very different from “a casual explainer for a blog audience.” If you have a specific lens in mind—formal, conversational, persuasive, technical—say so upfront rather than editing after the fact.\\n\\n- **Examples and comparisons**: Asking the model to include analogies or concrete examples often makes the output more useful and easier to apply. A prompt like “Explain how neural networks learn and give me a real-world comparison” produces a more memorable response than one that stays purely abstract—like “Explain how neural networks learn,” which might give you a technically accurate but harder-to-grasp explanation\\n\\n**💡 Detailed report outline prompt example**:\\n\\nPlease provide an outline for a comprehensive report that analyzes the current trends in social media marketing for technology companies, focusing on the developments from 2025 onward. Include space for both established platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X, as well as emerging options like Bluesky and Threads.\\n\\nThe outline should include an introduction, three main sections addressing different aspects of social media trends, and a conclusion summarizing the findings. Please suggest the types of graphs that could illustrate user engagement trends and list bullet points that summarize key marketing strategies in each section.\\n\\n### [2. Supply the AI with examples](#2-supply-the-ai-with-examples)\\n\\nIncorporating examples into your prompts steers the AI’s responses in the desired direction. By providing examples as you write prompts, you set a precedent for the type of information or response you expect. This practice is particularly useful for complex tasks where the desired output might be ambiguous or for creative tasks with more than one relevant answer.\\n\\nWhen you supply the AI with examples, ensure they represent the quality and style of your desired result. This strategy clarifies your expectations and helps the AI model its responses after the examples provided, leading to more accurate and tailored outputs.\\n\\nHere are some example types you could provide to an AI to help guide it toward generating the best response possible:\\n\\n- **Sample texts**: Share excerpts reflecting the style, tone, and content you want the AI to replicate. For instance, if you’re writing a company newsletter, paste a previous edition and prompt: “Write next month’s newsletter update in this same voice and format.”\\n\\n- **Data formats**: To guide the AI’s output, provide specific data structures, such as table layouts or spreadsheet formats. You might include a sample row like “| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock |” and ask the model to populate the rest based on a product list you provide.\\n\\n- **Document templates**: Offer templates to ensure the AI’s response follows a desired structure and format. For a weekly status report, you could share your existing template with headers like “Accomplishments,” “Blockers,” and “Next Steps,” then ask the AI to fill it in based on your notes.\\n\\n- **Code snippets**: Provide code examples if you need help with programming tasks to ensure correct syntax and logic. If you want a [Python](/community/tutorials/python-tutorial) function that follows your team’s conventions, paste an existing function and prompt: “Write a new function that validates email addresses using the same structure and commenting style.”\\n\\n- **Graphs and charts examples**: If you’re asking the AI to create similar graphics, share samples of visual data representation. You might include a screenshot of a bar chart from a previous quarterly report with the prompt: “Generate the data and labels for a chart like this showing Q3 performance.”\\n\\n- **Marketing copy**: If you’re crafting marketing content, share ad copy that aligns with your brand’s voice for the AI to mimic. For example, paste a landing page headline and subhead from a previous product launch and prompt: “Write three variations of launch copy for our new API feature using this same tone and structure.”\\n\\n**💡 Comparison table prompt example**:\\n\\nCreate a comparison table for two project management tools, Tool A and Tool B.\\n\\nInclude the following categories: Price, Key Features, User Reviews, and Support Options. For instance, under Key Features, list things like ‘Task Assignment’, ‘Time Tracking’, and ‘File Sharing’.\\n\\nThe format should mirror something like this:\\n\\n| Feature | Tool A | Tool B |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Price | $X per user/month | $Y per user/month |\\n| Key Features | Task Assignment, Time Tracking, File Sharing | Task Assignment, Time Tracking, File Sharing |\\n| User Reviews | X stars | Y stars |\\n| Support Options | 24/7 Live Chat, Email | Business Hours Phone, Email |\\n\\nPlease ensure the table is concise and suitable for inclusion in a business report.\\n\\n### [3. Get better answers by providing data](#3-get-better-answers-by-providing-data)\\n\\nMost LLMs now allow you to attach documents, images, spreadsheets, and other files directly to your prompts—and many also connect to tools like Google Drive, Notion, or GitHub to pull in context automatically. This makes it easy to incorporate specific data into your prompts… However, just because you can connect these tools doesn’t mean you should give unfettered access to all your business and personal files. Be selective: only share what’s necessary for the task at hand, and check whether your data might be used for model training—most platforms let you [opt out of this in settings](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).\\n\\nWith [AI privacy](/resources/articles/ai-and-privacy) in mind, incorporating data into prompts improves the quality of AI-generated responses, providing a solid foundation for the AI to understand the context and craft precise answers. Provide data that includes numerical values, dates, or categories, organized in a clear and structured way. Also, remember to give context to the data and, when possible, to cite its source. When you give the AI concrete data with clear context, it does more than summarize—it analyzes trends, spots patterns, and surfaces insights you might have missed. This is especially valuable for tasks like financial analysis, market research, or performance reporting, where the output needs to be grounded in real numbers rather than general observations.\\n\\nIf you need to work with a specific set of documents rather than the entire web, tools like [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) let you upload your own files and get citation-backed responses grounded only in that material. For a broader look at research-focused AI tools that handle documents and data differently than general chatbots, check out our guide to [Perplexity alternatives](/resources/articles/perplexity-alternatives).\\n\\n**💡 Quarterly sales analysis prompt example**:\\n\\nPlease analyze the sales data from the first quarter of 2025 provided in the attached PDF document. I need a summary that identifies our best-selling product, the overall sales trend, and any notable patterns in customer purchases.\\n\\nThe PDF contains detailed monthly sales units for three products: Product A, Product B, and Product C. After reviewing the data, summarize your findings in a concise paragraph that is suitable for a weekly business review. Highlight significant increases or decreases in sales and offer insights into potential factors driving these trends.\\n\\n### [4. Specify your desired output](#4-specify-your-desired-output)\\n\\nWhether you’re chatting with [Gemini or ChatGPT](/resources/articles/gemini-vs-chatgpt), articulate the precise format and structure you expect in the response. Specify whether you require a detailed report, a summary, bullet points, or a narrative form to ensure the AI tailors its output to your needs. For instance, a prompt like “Give me a bulleted list of key takeaways” will produce something very different from “Write this up as a two-paragraph executive summary.”\\n\\nIndicate any preferences such as tone, style, and the inclusion of certain elements like headings or subheadings. If you need a specific structure—like a blog post with an H1, three H2 sections, and a conclusion—say so explicitly rather than hoping the model infers it. By clearly defining your desired output, you guide the AI to deliver information that aligns with your intended use.\\n\\n**💡 Historical timeline prompt example**:\\n\\nCreate a comprehensive overview of the key milestones in the history of software development. The output should be structured as a timeline with bullet points, each bullet including the year, the milestone event, and a brief description of its significance. Start from the 1980s. The tone should be educational. Please limit the overview to twenty major milestones to maintain conciseness.\\n\\n### [5. Provide instructions on what to do instead of what *not* to do](#5-provide-instructions-on-what-to-do-instead-of-what-_not_-to-do)\\n\\nWhile LLMs continue to evolve and improve, they still stumble on negated prompts—instructions telling them what not to do, like “avoid bullet points.” A [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12711) conducted by researchers at KAIST found that larger models actually perform worse on these types of instructions, struggling more than smaller models to process negative framing. When constructing prompts for AI, it’s more effective to direct the system toward the desired action rather than detailing what it should avoid. This positive instruction approach reduces ambiguity and focuses the AI’s processing power on generating constructive outcomes.\\n\\nNegative instructions often require the AI to interpret and invert them, increasing the cognitive load and potential for misunderstanding. By clearly stating the intended actions, you enable the AI to apply its capabilities directly to fulfilling the task at hand, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the response.\\n\\n**💡 Positive instruction framing prompt examples**:\\n\\n- Avoid: \\\"Don’t write too much detail. → Use Instead: “Please provide a concise summary.”\\n\\n- Avoid: “Don’t use technical jargon.” → Use Instead: “Write with clear and simple language accessible to a general audience.”\\n\\n- Avoid: “Don’t give examples from before the year 2000.” → Use Instead: “Provide examples from the year 2000 onwards.”\\n\\n### [6. Give the model a persona or frame of reference](#6-give-the-model-a-persona-or-frame-of-reference)\\n\\nPersona prompting is a technique in its own right, but it also complements other strategies, such as few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning. By assigning the model a specific identity or expertise, you shape the tone, vocabulary, and depth of the response to match your needs.\\n\\nThis works across use cases:\\n\\n- **For generating images**: “You are a fine art photographer with a focus on dramatic lighting.”\\n\\n- **For coding**: “You are a senior backend engineer reviewing this Python script for security vulnerabilities.”\\n\\n- **For writing**: “You are a tech journalist explaining this concept to a non-technical audience.”\\n\\nThe persona sets expectations and helps the model calibrate its output to the task at hand.\\n\\n**💡 Product manager persona prompt example**:\\n\\nYou are a senior technical product manager preparing for customer discovery interviews. Based on the attached product requirements document, draft a list of 10 open-ended questions to ask prospective users about their current workflow pain points and feature priorities.\\n\\nFocus on questions that will surface unmet needs without leading the respondent toward a specific answer. Keep the tone conversational but professional.\\n\\n### [7. Try a prompt optimizer tool](#7-try-a-prompt-optimizer-tool)\\n\\nIf you’re running the same prompt repeatedly—for data extraction, content generation, or any structured task—consider using a prompt optimizer to automatically improve it. These tools test variations of your prompt, evaluate the results against your criteria, and iteratively refine the instructions until performance improves. The process is similar to what you’d do manually, but faster and more systematic: the optimizer proposes changes, measures their effectiveness, and retains the best-performing versions.\\n\\nHere are some prompt optimization tools to explore:\\n\\n- [DSPy (with GEPA optimizer)](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy): Open-source framework that treats prompts as learnable parameters and uses reflection-based optimization.\\n\\n- [OpenAI Prompt Optimizer](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-optimizer): Built-in tool for refining prompts using your own datasets.\\n\\n- [Opik Agent Optimizer](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/agent_optimization/algorithms/metaprompt_optimizer): Supports multiple optimization algorithms, including evolutionary and Bayesian approaches.\\n\\n- [LangWatch](https://langwatch.ai/prompt-optimizer): LLM ops platform with prompt optimization studio.\\n\\n- [PromptPerfect](https://promptperfect.jina.ai/): Automatic optimization for text and image model prompts.\\n\\nEven if you’re not ready to run an optimizer yourself, the takeaway still applies: treat prompt engineering as an iterative process, and don’t be afraid to test multiple variations to find what works best.\\n\\nExplore how [DSPy replaces manual prompt tuning](/community/tutorials/prompting-with-dspy) with declarative programs, adaptive modules, and built-in optimizers that improve language model behavior through compilation. See practical examples of question answering and retrieval-augmented pipelines that show measurable gains in accuracy with minimal training data.\\n\\n### [8. Split complex tasks into simpler ones](#8-split-complex-tasks-into-simpler-ones)\\n\\nWhen dealing with complex tasks, breaking them into simpler, more manageable components (or prompt chaining) makes them more approachable for an LLM. This applies to everything from writing a multi-section report to building a financial model, debugging a codebase, developing a content calendar, or drafting a legal contract. Using step-by-step instructions helps prevent the AI from becoming overwhelmed and ensures that each part of the task is handled with attention to detail.\\n\\nAdditionally, this approach allows for easier monitoring and adjustment of each step, facilitating better quality control throughout the process. By compartmentalizing tasks, the AI also uses its resources more efficiently, allocating the necessary attention where it’s most needed.\\n\\n**💡 Task breakdown prompt example**:\\n\\nAvoid a single broad prompt:\\n\\n- “Write a 1500-word article on the impact of AI on remote work.”\\n\\n\\nTry an initial prompt and follow-up prompts instead:\\n\\n1. “Develop a detailed outline for a 1500-word article titled ‘Revolutionizing Remote Work: The Role of AI for Tech Professionals.’ The outline should include an engaging introduction, three main sections titled ‘Enhancing Productivity with AI Tools,’ ‘AI-Driven Communication Optimization,’ and ‘Advanced Project Management through AI,’ plus a conclusion that offers a perspective on future developments.”\\n\\n2. “Compose a detailed introduction for the article ‘Revolutionizing Remote Work: The Role of AI for Tech Professionals.’ The introduction should be 150-200 words, setting the stage for how AI is changing the game for remote workers in the tech industry, and providing a hook that will entice tech professionals to continue reading.”\\n\\n### [9. Understand the model’s shortcomings](#9-understand-the-model-s-shortcomings)\\n\\nIn crafting prompts for an AI, recognize the model’s limitations to set realistic expectations. Prompting AI to perform tasks it’s not designed for—or expecting certainty where it only offers probabilities—will lead to frustration and potentially misleading outputs.\\n\\nHere are some known shortcomings of AI models:\\n\\n- **Hallucinations are inherent, not a bug**: LLMs predict the next most likely word based on patterns—they don’t verify truth. When uncertain, they often generate plausible-sounding but fabricated information.\\n\\n- **Context window limits affect long inputs**: Models only process a fixed number of tokens at once. In long documents or conversations, earlier context may get lost, leading to contradictions or forgotten details—a phenomenon sometimes called the “[lost in the middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172)” effect.\\n\\n- **Training data has a cutoff**: Models don’t have access to events or information after their training cutoff date unless they search the web or access external tools.\\n\\n- **Confidence doesn’t equal accuracy**: A model often sounds equally confident about correct facts and complete fabrications. High confidence in a response is not a reliable indicator of correctness, so it remains important to validate facts yourself.\\n\\n- **Complex reasoning compounds errors**: In multi-step tasks, small errors early on may snowball into larger inaccuracies by the end—especially in longer outputs or chain-of-thought reasoning.\\n\\n- **Nuance and ambiguity are challenging**: Sarcasm, cultural references, and domain-specific jargon often trip up even advanced models, leading to misinterpretations or overly literal responses.\\n\\n- **Training data reflects societal biases**: Models trained on internet text absorb [biases](/resources/articles/ai-bias) around race, gender, political ideology, geographic regions, and economic status. The result can be outputs that favor certain perspectives or make unwarranted assumptions about demographics and context.\\n\\n### [10. Take an experimental approach to prompting](#10-take-an-experimental-approach-to-prompting)\\n\\nPrompt engineering has evolved from a niche skill to a more established discipline, characterized by dedicated research, published best practices, and a growing library of techniques. But it’s still a field where experimentation pays off. The best practices in this guide—and others online—are a starting point, not a ceiling. These tools have only been commercially available for a couple of years, which means there are no established experts—just early practitioners learning alongside everyone else. You’ll often discover techniques specific to your use case, your model, or your workflow that aren’t documented anywhere.\\n\\nTest your prompts iteratively. Small changes in wording, structure, or instruction order alter the output, and you’ll only learn how a model responds by trying things out. What works for code generation in Claude might not work the same way in [GPT-5](/resources/articles/gpt-5-overview) and a prompt that produces great results for image generation in Midjourney might need a completely different approach in DALL-E. Keep notes on what works and what doesn’t across different models and tasks—whether you’re writing marketing copy, debugging Python scripts, or generating product visuals—and don’t be afraid to deviate from established patterns if you find something that performs better.\\n\\n## [Defensive prompt engineering](#defensive-prompt-engineering)\\n\\nIf you’re [building AI products](/resources/articles/building-ai-products) that accept user input and pass it to an LLM, you need to think about prompt injection—a type of attack where malicious inputs manipulate the model into ignoring its original instructions or revealing sensitive information. This isn’t just a concern for developers building [AI chatbots](/resources/articles/ai-agent-vs-ai-chatbot); it applies to any workflow where untrusted text gets processed by a model, from document summarizers to [AI-powered search tools](/resources/articles/ai-search-engines-for-research).\\n\\nThe following tactics help reduce your exposure, though no single defense is foolproof—layering multiple approaches provides the strongest protection.\\n\\n- **Use delimiters to separate instructions from user input**: Wrapping user-provided content in clear markers like ###, “”\\\", or XML tags helps the model distinguish between your system instructions and the data it should process. Pair this with instructions telling the model to treat the delimited content as inert data, not commands to follow.\\n\\n- **Sanitize and validate inputs before they reach the model**: Scan incoming text for suspicious patterns like “ignore previous instructions,” “forget your rules,” or attempts to inject your own delimiter characters. Filtering known attack phrases and rejecting abnormally long or strangely formatted inputs adds friction for anyone trying to manipulate the system.\\n\\n- **Apply the principle of least privilege**: Restrict your LLM application’s access to only the data sources and actions it genuinely needs, and use the lowest permissions possible. This doesn’t prevent prompt injection, but it limits the damage if an attack succeeds.\\n\\n- **Audit outputs before acting on them**: If your LLM generates commands, code, or API calls, validate those outputs through rule-based checks or a secondary classifier before executing them. Treating the model’s output as untrusted—just like user input—prevents a successful injection from cascading into your systems.\\n\\n- **Test your prompts adversarially**: Run red-team exercises where you actively try to break your own system using known injection techniques, jailbreak patterns, and edge cases. Regularly testing with inputs like “Ignore all above instructions and…” helps you identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.\\n\\n## [Prompt engineering best practices FAQs](#prompt-engineering-best-practices-faqs)\\n\\n**What is the difference between few-shot and zero-shot prompting?**\\n\\nZero-shot prompting is when you give the AI a direct instruction without any examples, relying on the model to understand and complete the task from the instruction alone. Few-shot prompting involves providing one or more input-output examples before your actual request, which helps the model learn the format, tone, or style you’re looking for. Few-shot prompting is particularly useful when you need consistent formatting or when the task involves subtle patterns that are easier to show than describe.\\n\\n**Do I need to know how to code to use prompt engineering?**\\n\\nNo—the core techniques are about communicating clearly with the model, not technical expertise. In fact, creatives often excel at prompt engineering because they’re practiced at describing concepts, setting tone, and iterating on feedback. That said, coding knowledge helps when you’re working with structured outputs like JSON, using the API directly, or building prompts into automated workflows.\\n\\n**Can prompt engineering help reduce AI hallucinations?**\\n\\nYes, several techniques help. Providing relevant data or context gives the model a factual foundation to work from, and explicitly giving the model permission to say “I don’t know” reduces the likelihood of fabricated answers. Chain-of-thought prompting also helps because it forces the model to show its work, making errors easier to spot.\\n\\n**What are common mistakes to avoid in prompt engineering?**\\n\\nBeing too vague is one of the most common issues—asking for “a summary” without specifying length, format, or focus leaves too much room for interpretation. Other frequent mistakes include overloading a single prompt with multiple unrelated tasks, using negative instructions instead of positive framing, and skipping iteration rather than testing and refining based on results.\\n\\n**What are the risks of prompt injection, and how do I prevent them?**\\n\\nPrompt injection occurs when malicious or accidental input manipulates an LLM into ignoring its original instructions or revealing sensitive information. To reduce risk, use delimiters to separate system instructions from user input, sanitize inputs for suspicious patterns, and validate the model’s outputs before acting on them.\\n\\n## [Build with DigitalOcean’s Gradient Platform](#build-with-digitalocean-s-gradient-platform)\\n\\n[DigitalOcean Gradient Platform](/products/gradientai/platform) makes it easier to build and deploy AI agents without managing complex infrastructure.

Engineering for Python Code Generation](https://keploy.io/blog/community/prompt-engineering-for-python-code-generation-with-keploy)**\\n\\nPrompt engineering is an essential technique for optimizing AI-generated Python code, ensuring accurate, efficient, and context-aware outputs. As AI-powered tools like OpenAI’s GPT, GitHub Copilot, and Keploy gain popularity in software development, crafting well-structured prompts becomes crucial for generating high-quality Python code. This guide explores the fundamentals of prompt engineering and best practices for AI-driven Python code generation.\\n\\n**[What is Prompt Engineering](https://keploy.io/blog/community/prompt-engineering-for-python-code-generation-with-keploy)?**\\n\\nPrompt engineering involves designing and structuring inputs to guide AI models in producing high-quality responses. In the context of Python code generation, well-crafted prompts ensure the AI understands the intent and delivers precise results. By refining how queries are structured, developers can enhance the quality of AI-generated code, making it more readable, maintainable, and efficient.\\n\\n**Why is Prompt Engineering Important for Python Code Generation?**\\n\\nAI models rely on prompts to generate relevant and accurate code. A poorly structured prompt can lead to ambiguous or incorrect outputs, requiring additional effort to debug and refine. A well-structured prompt reduces ambiguity, improves efficiency, and minimizes the need for extensive post-processing. Prompt engineering is especially crucial for automated test generation tools like Keploy, which leverage AI to create reliable test cases for applications.\\n\\n**Key Strategies for Effective Prompt Engineering**\\n\\nTo generate better Python code with AI, consider the following strategies:\\n\\n**1. Be Specific and Contextual**\\n\\nProviding clear instructions and specifying the expected output format helps AI models generate more accurate results. Instead of asking, \\\"Write a Python function,\\\" a better prompt would be, \\\"Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a sorted list using the quicksort algorithm.\\\"\\n\\n**2. Use Examples to Guide the AI**\\n\\nIncluding input-output examples in your prompt helps AI understand patterns and expectations for code generation. For instance:\\n\\nPrompt: Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome.\\n\\nExample Input: 'radar'\\n\\nExample Output: True\\n\\nBy providing examples, AI can better align with the expected behavior.\\n\\n**3. Define Constraints and Requirements**\\n\\nExplicitly stating programming constraints, such as using specific libraries or avoiding certain functions, refines the generated output. If you want to generate a machine learning model using TensorFlow instead of PyTorch, include that in the prompt.\\n\\n**4. Break Down Complex Tasks into Steps**\\n\\nSplitting a large problem into smaller tasks improves AI performance and ensures structured code generation. Instead of asking AI to \\\"build a chatbot,\\\" break it down into \\\"write a Python function to handle user input,\\\" \\\"generate responses using an NLP model,\\\" and \\\"deploy the chatbot using Flask.\\\"\\n\\n**Common Challenges in AI-Generated Python Code**\\n\\nDespite advancements, AI-generated Python code may have challenges such as logical errors, lack of optimization, or missing edge cases. Effective prompt engineering can mitigate these issues by providing clear instructions and expected behavior. Keploy, an AI-powered test case generation tool, can help validate and refine AI-generated code by automating the testing process and identifying potential issues.\\n\\n**Practical Examples of Prompt Engineering for Python Code**\\n\\n**Example 1: Generating a Simple Function**\\n\\nPrompt:\\n\\nWrite a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum value.\\n\\nGenerated Code:\\n\\ndef find_max(numbers):\\n\\nreturn max(numbers)\\n\\n**Example 2: Enforcing Coding Standards**\\n\\nPrompt:\\n\\nWrite a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number, following PEP 8 style guide.\\n\\nGenerated Code:\\n\\ndef factorial(n):\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"Returns the factorial of a given number.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nif n == 0:\\n\\nreturn 1\\n\\nreturn n * factorial(n - 1)\\n\\n**Example 3: Using External Libraries**\\n\\nPrompt:\\n\\nWrite a Python function that uses NumPy to generate a random array of size 10.\\n\\nGenerated Code:\\n\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef random_array():\\n\\nreturn np.random.rand(10)\\n\\n**Tools for Python Code Generation with AI**\\n\\nSeveral AI-powered tools assist in generating Python code efficiently. Some of the notable tools include:\\n\\n- **OpenAI’s GPT** – Generates Python code based on structured prompts.\\n- **GitHub Copilot** – Suggests code snippets within the IDE.\\n- **Keploy** – Automates test case generation and ensures AI-generated code is reliable and functional.\\n\\n\\n**Best Practices for Refining AI-Generated Code**\\n\\n1. **Review and Validate Output** – Always test AI-generated code for correctness and efficiency.\\n2. **Optimize for Readability** – Ensure the generated code follows best practices for maintainability.\\n3. **Use AI for Assistance, Not Replacement** – AI can enhance productivity but should complement human expertise.\\n4. **Leverage Keploy for Test Generation** – AI-generated code should be tested to ensure robustness, and Keploy can automate test creation for better validation.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nPrompt engineering is a powerful skill that enhances AI-driven Python code generation. By crafting precise, structured prompts, developers can improve AI accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in coding tasks. Whether generating new functions, enforcing coding standards, or integrating external libraries, well-designed prompts ensure optimal AI-generated output. Additionally, tools like Keploy help validate and test AI-generated code, ensuring its reliability in real-world applications.\\n\\nMastering prompt engineering not only improves the quality of AI-generated Python code but also enhances overall development efficiency, making AI an invaluable assistant in modern software engineering.\\n\\n========================\\n## Table of contents[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#table-of-contents](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#table-of-contents)\\n\\n- [Be specific with language and requirements](#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n- [Include examples and constraints](#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n- [Break down complex tasks and iterate](#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n- [Avoid common prompting pitfalls](#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n- [Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency](#graphites-Graphite Agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\n\\n[Large language models (LLMs)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/intro-llms) can generate code in many programming languages, but the quality of their output depends heavily on how you prompt them. Crafting a precise prompt can be the difference between hours of debugging and a seamless implementation. The key is to clearly communicate your intent and requirements, because an AI doesn't inherently know your goals – it only follows the patterns described in your prompt. This guide introduces language-agnostic prompt engineering techniques to help both beginners and experienced developers get more accurate and useful code from AI. We'll illustrate each technique with examples of weak vs. improved prompts to show how small changes can yield better results. For a deeper dive into how AI code review works, see our [guide on AI code review](https://graphite.com/guides/ai-code-review).\\n\\n### Be specific with language and requirements[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n\\nThe first rule of prompt engineering for code is to be specific about what you want. Vague prompts yield vague (often incorrect) results. Always mention the programming language, the task or algorithm, and any requirements or constraints. For example, consider asking an AI to generate a sorting algorithm:\\n\\n- **Weak prompt:** \\\"Write a sorting algorithm.\\\"\\n- **Improved prompt:** \\\"Write a **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** implementation of **merge sort** optimized for **memory efficiency**, including **time complexity analysis** and **error handling** for edge cases (e.g. empty arrays).\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe improved prompt is much clearer. It specifies:\\n\\n- The programming language (Python) and specific algorithm (merge sort).\\n- The optimization goal (memory efficiency) and required output details (time complexity analysis).\\n- Error handling expectations and an edge case to consider (empty arrays).\\n\\n\\nBy spelling out these details, you greatly reduce ambiguity. [Microsoft's Developer Tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/) research group observed that prompts with explicit specifications reduced the need for back-and-forth refinements by 68%. In practice, this means the AI is more likely to produce correct, ready-to-use code on the first try.\\n\\nBeing specific also means providing technical context when relevant. If certain constraints matter – such as the target environment, API version, performance or security requirements – include them in the prompt. For instance, specify \\\"Node.js 18 server environment\\\" or \\\"Python 3.10+\\\" if it matters. Otherwise, the model might generate code that is technically correct but not suitable for your situation.\\n> **Tip:** AI code review tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) can help enforce technical requirements and catch missing context.\\n\\n### Include examples and constraints[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n\\nAnother powerful technique is to provide examples or test cases in your prompt. Examples act as implicit constraints, guiding the model toward the format or behavior you expect. For instance, if you want a function with a specific signature or output format, show a snippet of that.\\n\\nImagine you need an email validation function. A weak prompt might just say, \\\"Validate an email address.\\\" An improved prompt would describe requirements and give a usage example, e.g.:\\n> **Prompt:** \\\"Create a TypeScript function `validateEmail(email: string): {isValid: boolean; message: string}` that checks if an email is RFC-5322 compliant and rejects disposable domains. For example, if the input is `\\\"test@tempmail.com\\\"`, it should return an object like `{ isValid: false, message: 'Disposable domain not allowed' }`.\\\"\\n\\nIn this improved version, the prompt lists specific rules (RFC compliance and no disposable domains) and provides a clear function signature and an example of expected output. This gives the AI a template to follow and boundaries to respect. As Dr. Rachel Thomas of fast.ai notes, *\\\"examples in prompts serve as implicit constraints that guide the model toward the desired output format.\\\"* By including a small example or an outline of the output, you help the model understand exactly what you want.\\n\\n### Break down complex tasks and iterate[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n\\nIf your desired output is complex, avoid requesting everything in one huge prompt. It's often better to break down a complex task into smaller steps or use an iterative approach. Large models can handle reasonably detailed prompts, but asking for a full application in one go is likely to produce a convoluted or partial answer. Instead, tackle complex tasks in stages and possibly across multiple prompts:\\n\\n1. **Decompose the problem:** Outline sub-tasks in separate prompts (e.g. first define the data model, then the API endpoints, then the UI components). This ensures each part is handled with focus.\\n2. **Use step-by-step reasoning:** You can actually instruct the model to \\\"think step by step.\\\" For example: \\\"I need a JavaScript function to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Let's solve this step by step: first explain the concept, then choose an algorithm (greedy vs DP), then write the code, then analyze complexity.\\\" By embedding this reasoning process in the prompt, you encourage the AI to work through the problem methodically.\\n3. **Iterate with the AI:** Treat the AI's first output as a draft. Review it, then issue follow-up prompts to refine the code.\\n\\n\\nBy breaking prompts into smaller pieces or sequential turns, you make it easier for the model to comply at each step. You also get opportunities to catch mistakes early and steer the output in the right direction. Remember that you can carry context between prompts (in a chat-based LLM) – use that to your advantage for iterative improvement.\\n\\nFor more information on [integrating AI into your code review workflow](https://graphite.com/guides/integrating-ai-code-review-workflow) and [how to review code written by AI](https://graphite.com/guides/how-to-review-code-written-by-ai), these guides offer practical advice for iterative, AI-assisted development.\\n\\n### Avoid common prompting pitfalls[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n\\nWhile applying the above techniques, watch out for a few common mistakes that can undermine your results:\\n\\n- **Under-specifying the task:** Don't assume the AI \\\"knows\\\" what you intended. If a prompt is too minimal, the model might solve the wrong problem or omit important features. Always double-check that your prompt fully describes the problem.\\n- **Ignoring context or constraints:** Failing to mention the operating environment, framework, or performance/security constraints can result in code that doesn't fit your project needs. Also make sure to include any version requirements or security considerations. Without this, you might get code that technically works but is impractical or unsafe for your use case. The more context you give, the more relevant the output.\\n- **Over-reliance on AI without verification:** Even with good prompts, AI-generated code isn't guaranteed to be perfect. The model might produce subtle logic bugs, use deprecated APIs, or just take an unconventional approach. Never merge AI-written code into production without reviewing it. Treat the AI as a coding assistant, not an infallible coder. Write prompts that encourage best practices (like asking for safe, idiomatic code), and always test and review the output thoroughly. Using linters or static analysis on AI code is also a smart safeguard.\\n> **To compare approaches:** This guide, [Automated vs. manual code reviews: Finding the right balance](https://graphite.com/guides/automated-vs-manual-code-reviews), explores the strengths and limitations of both, and how to combine them for best results.\\n\\nBy avoiding these pitfalls, you ensure that prompt engineering remains a helpful aid rather than a source of technical debt. Prompting is an iterative learning process – over time, you'll learn which clarifications or extra details yield better code from your preferred LLM.\\n\\n### Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\nWriting a good prompt is the first step, but ensuring the quality and consistency of AI-generated code is the next challenge. This is where tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) come in. Graphite Agent is an AI-powered code review assistant that provides immediate, context-aware feedback on code changes – including those written by an AI. It hooks into your development workflow (e.g. reviewing [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)) and flags issues ranging from logic bugs and security vulnerabilities to style violations and missing documentation. Graphite Agent uses your repository's context and even custom rules you define to give relevant suggestions. For example, you can configure Graphite Agent with your project's style guide or common AI mistakes to watch for, and it will catch those patterns in AI-generated code before a human reviewer even sees them.\\n\\n![screenshot of Graphite Agent comment](/images/content/guides/better-prompts-ai-code/sample-Graphite Agent-comment.png)\\n\\nBy incorporating a tool like Graphite Agent in your workflow, you add an extra layer of scrutiny for AI-produced code. It helps ensure the code meets your team's quality standards and is consistent with the rest of your codebase. In practice, Graphite Agent can automatically identify edge cases the AI missed, point out performance issues, and even suggest fixes – all of which saves human reviewers time and instills confidence in using AI-generated code. Remember, prompt engineering and AI coding tools are most effective when paired with robust review practices. [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) bridges that gap by reviewing AI code for you, so you can safely harness AI code generation while maintaining high code quality and consistency.\\n\\n========================\\nYou’ve used [ChatGPT](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python/), and you understand the potential of using a **large language model (LLM)** to assist you in your tasks. Maybe you’re already working on an LLM-supported application and have read about **prompt engineering**, but you’re unsure how to translate the theoretical concepts into a practical example.\\n\\nYour text prompt instructs the LLM’s responses, so tweaking it can get you vastly different output. In this tutorial, you’ll apply multiple **prompt engineering techniques** to a real-world example. You’ll experience prompt engineering as an iterative process, see the effects of applying various techniques, and learn about related concepts from machine learning and data engineering.\\n\\n**In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:**\\n\\n- Work with OpenAI’s **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4** models through their **API**\\n- Apply prompt engineering techniques to a **practical, real-world example**\\n- Use **numbered steps**, **delimiters**, and **few-shot prompting** to improve your results\\n- Understand and use **chain-of-thought prompting** to add more context\\n- Tap into the power of **roles** in messages to go beyond using singular **role prompts**\\n\\n\\nYou’ll work with a **Python script** that you can repurpose to fit your own LLM-assisted task. So if you’d like to use practical examples to discover how you can use prompt engineering to get better results from an LLM, then you’ve found the right tutorial!\\n\\n== **Take the Quiz:**== Test your knowledge with our interactive “Practical Prompt Engineering” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[Prompt Engineering: A Practical Example](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\n**Interactive Quiz**\\n\\n[Practical Prompt Engineering](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\nIn this quiz, you'll test your understanding of prompt engineering techniques with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. You'll revisit how to work with OpenAI's API, apply prompt engineering techniques to practical examples, and use various strategies to improve your results.\\n\\n## Understand the Purpose of Prompt Engineering[](#understand-the-purpose-of-prompt-engineering \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nPrompt engineering is more than a buzzword. You can get vastly different output from an LLM when using different prompts. That may seem obvious when you consider that you get different output when you ask different questions—but it also applies to phrasing the same conceptual question differently. Prompt engineering means constructing your text input to the LLM using specific approaches.\\n\\nYou can think of prompts as arguments and the LLM as the function to which you pass these arguments. Different input means different output:\\n\\nWhile an LLM is much more complex than the toy function above, the fundamental idea holds true. For a successful function call, you’ll need to know exactly which argument will produce the desired output. In the case of an LLM, that argument is text that consists of many different **tokens**, or [pieces of words](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).\\n\\nThe field of prompt engineering is still changing rapidly, and there’s a lot of active research happening in this area. As LLMs continue to evolve, so will the prompting approaches that will help you achieve the best results.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you’ll cover some prompt engineering techniques, along with approaches to iteratively developing prompts, that you can use to get better text completions for your own LLM-assisted projects:\\n\\n- [Zero-Shot Prompting](#describe-your-task)\\n- [Few-Shot Prompting](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output)\\n- [Delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt)\\n- [Numbered Steps](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps)\\n- [Role Prompts](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone)\\n- [Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting)\\n- [Structured Output](#structure-your-output-format-as-json)\\n- [Labeled Conversations](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation)\\n\\n\\nThere are more techniques to uncover, and you’ll also find links to additional resources in the tutorial. Applying the mentioned techniques in a practical example will give you a great starting point for improving your LLM-supported programs. If you’ve never worked with an LLM before, then you may want to peruse [OpenAI’s GPT documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) before diving in, but you should be able to follow along either way.\\n\\n## Get to Know the Practical Prompt Engineering Project[](#get-to-know-the-practical-prompt-engineering-project \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ll explore various prompt engineering techniques in service of a practical example: [sanitizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sanitization) customer chat conversations. By practicing different prompt engineering techniques on a single real-world project, you’ll get a good idea of why you might want to use one technique over another and how you can apply them in practice.\\n\\nImagine that you’re the resident Python developer at a company that handles thousands of customer support chats on a daily basis. Your job is to format and sanitize these conversations. You also help with deciding which of them require additional attention.\\n\\n### Collect Your Tasks[](#collect-your-tasks \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYour big-picture assignment is to help your company stay on top of handling customer chat conversations. The conversations that you work with may look like the one shown below:\\n\\nYou’re supposed to make these text conversations more accessible for further processing by the customer support department in a few different ways:\\n> - Remove personally identifiable information.\\n> - Remove swear words.\\n> - Clean the date-time information to only show the date.\\n\\nThe swear words that you’ll encounter in this tutorial won’t be spicy at all, but you can consider them stand-ins for more explicit phrasing that you might find out in the wild. After sanitizing the chat conversation, you’d expect it to look like this:\\n\\nSure—you could handle it [using Python’s `str.replace()`](https://realpython.com/replace-string-python/) or [show off](https://xkcd.com/208) your [regular expression](https://realpython.com/regex-python/) skills. But there’s more to the task than immediately meets the eye.\\n\\nYour project manager isn’t a technical person, and they stuck another task at the end of this list. They may think of the task as a normal continuation of the previous tasks. But you know that it requires an entirely different approach and technology stack:\\n> Mark the conversations as “positive” or “negative.”\\n\\nThat task lies in the realm of [machine learning](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/machine-learning-python/), namely [text classification](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/), and more specifically [sentiment analysis](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/). Even [advanced regex skills](https://realpython.com/regex-python-part-2/) won’t get you far in this challenge.\\n\\nAdditionally, you know that the customer support team that you’re preparing the data for will want to continue working on it programmatically. Plain text isn’t necessarily the best format for doing that. You want to do work that’s useful for others, so you add yet another stretch goal to your growing list of tasks:\\n> Format the output as JSON.\\n\\nThis task list is quickly growing out of proportion! Fortunately, you’ve got access to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/), and you’ll employ the help of their LLM to solve all of these challenges.\\n\\nOne of the impressive features of LLMs is the breadth of tasks that you can use them for. So you’ll cover a lot of ground and different areas of use. And you’ll learn how to tackle them all with prompt engineering techniques.\\n\\n### Prepare Your Tools[](#prepare-your-tools \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need to know how to [run a Python script](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) from your command-line interface (CLI), and you’ll need an [API key from OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).\\n\\nYou’ll focus on prompt engineering, so you’ll only use the CLI app as a tool to demonstrate the different techniques. However, if you want to understand the code that you’ll be using, then it’ll help to have some experience with [Python classes](https://realpython.com/python-classes/), [defining your own Python functions](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/), [the name-main idiom](https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/), and [using Python to interact with web APIs](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/).\\n\\nTo get started, go ahead and download the example Python script that you’ll work with throughout the tutorial:\\n\\nThe codebase represents a light abstraction layer on top of the OpenAI API and exposes one function called `get_chat_completion()` that’ll be of primary interest for the tutorial. The function interacts with OpenAI’s [`/chat/completions` endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) to generate responses using different models, such as **GPT-3.5-Turbo** and **GPT-4**. You’ll explore both models, starting with GPT-3.5-Turbo, and eventually you’ll move on to the more powerful GPT-4 model.\\n\\nMost of the code in `app.py` revolves around setting up and fetching the settings from `settings.toml`.\\n\\nThe script also parses a command-line argument to allow you to conveniently specify an input file.\\nThe input files that you’ll primarily work with contain [LLM-generated customer support chat conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08082), but feel free to reuse the script and provide your own input text files for additional practice.\\n\\nThe heart of the codebase is `settings.toml`. This [TOML settings file](https://realpython.com/python-toml/) hosts the prompts that you’ll use to sharpen your prompt engineering skills. It contains different prompts formatted in the human-readable settings format TOML.\\n\\nKeeping your prompts in a dedicated settings file can help to put them under [version control](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/), which means you can keep track of different versions of your prompts, which will inevitably change during development.\\n\\nYour Python script will read the prompts from `settings.toml`, assemble them meaningfully, and send an API requests to OpenAI.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can also run all the text prompts directly in the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), which will give you the same functionality as the script. You could even paste the prompts into the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) interface. However, the results will vary because you’ll be interacting with a different model and won’t have the opportunity to change certain settings.\\n\\n### Set Up the Codebase[](#set-up-the-codebase \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nMake sure that you’re on [Python 3.11](https://realpython.com/python311-new-features/) or higher, so that you can [interact with TOML files](https://realpython.com/python311-tomllib/) using the standard library. If you haven’t downloaded the codebase yet, go ahead and click the link below:\\n\\nUnzip the folder and use your CLI to navigate into the folder. You’ll see a handful of files. The most important ones are `app.py` and `settings.toml`:\\n\\n    ./\\n    ├── LICENSE\\n    ├── README.md\\n    ├── app.py\\n    ├── chats.txt\\n    ├── requirements.txt\\n    ├── sanitized-chats.txt\\n    ├── sanitized-testing-chats.txt\\n    ├── settings.toml\\n    ├── settings-final.toml\\n    └── testing-chats.txt\\n\\nThe file `settings.toml` contains placeholders for all the prompts that you’ll use to explore the different prompt engineering techniques. That’s the file that you’ll primarily work with, so open it up. You’ll use it to iteratively develop the prompts for your application.\\n\\nThe file `app.py` contains the Python code that ties the codebase together. You’ll run this script many times throughout the tutorial, and it’ll take care of pulling your prompts from `settings.toml`.\\n\\nAfter you’ve downloaded and unpacked the codebase, create and activate a new [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). Then use [`pip`](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) to install the required dependencies:\\n\\nNote that this tutorial uses `openai` version 1.13.3. OpenAI may introduce breaking changes between API versions, so make sure that you install the pinned dependencies from the requirements file. Then you’ll be able to work through the tutorial without any hiccups.\\n\\nTo run the script successfully, you’ll need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) with which to authenticate your API requests. Make sure to keep that key private and never commit it to version control! If you’re new to using API keys, then read up on [best practices for API key safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).\\n\\nTo integrate your API key with the script and avoid leaking it publicly, you can export the API key as an environment variable:\\n\\nAfter you’ve added your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the script will automatically pick it up during each run.\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve completed the necessary setup steps. You can now run the script using the command line and provide it with a file as additional input text:\\n\\nThe command shown above combines the customer support chat conversations in `chats.txt` with prompts and API call parameters that are saved in `settings.toml`, then sends a request to the OpenAI API. Finally, it prints the resulting text completion to your terminal.\\n\\nFrom now on, you’ll primarily make changes in `settings.toml`. The code in `app.py` is just here for your convenience, and you won’t have to edit that file at all. The changes in the LLM’s output will come from changing the prompts and a few of the API call arguments.\\n\\n### Freeze Responses by Setting the Temperature to Zero[](#freeze-responses-by-setting-the-temperature-to-zero \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nWhen you’re planning to integrate an LLM into a product or a workflow, then you’ll generally want deterministic responses. The same input should give you the same output. Otherwise, it gets hard to provide a consistent service or debug your program if something goes wrong.\\n\\nBecause of this, you’ll want to set the [`temperature` argument](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature) of your API calls to `0`. This value will mean that you’ll get *mostly* deterministic results.\\n\\nLLMs do text completion by predicting the next token based on the probability that it follows the previous tokens. Higher `temperature` settings will introduce more randomness into the results by allowing the LLM to pick tokens with lower probabilities. Because there are so many token selections chained one after one the other, picking one different token can sometimes lead to vastly different results.\\n\\nIf you use the LLM to generate ideas or [alternative implementations](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python/#prompt-chatgpt-for-alternative-implementations) of a programming task, then higher values for `temperature` might be interesting. However, they’re generally undesirable when you build a product.\\n\\nIn the example codebase, you can adjust `temperature` right inside your `settings.toml` file:\\n\\nThe initial value is set at `0`. All the examples in this tutorial assume that you leave `temperature` at `0` so that you’ll get mostly deterministic results. If you want to experiment with how a higher temperature changes the output, then feel free to play with it by changing the value for `temperature` in this settings file.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that you won’t be able to achieve true determinism with the current LLM models offered by OpenAI even if you keep `temperature` at `0`:\\n> An edge-case in GPT-3 with big implications: Inference is non-deterministic (even at temperature=0) when top-2 token probabilities are <1% different. So temperature=0 output is *very close* to deterministic, but actually isn’t. Worth remembering. ([Source](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1608525976702525440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw))\\n\\nSo, while you can’t entirely guarantee that the model will always return the same result, you can get much closer by setting `temperature` to `0`.\\n\\nAnother approach that improves determinism in the results is to set a value for [the `seed` parameter](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter). The provided code sets the seed to `12345`. However, this only has an effect on some of the models.\\n\\n## Start Engineering Your Prompts[](#start-engineering-your-prompts \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nNow that you have an understanding of prompt engineering and the practical project that you’ll be working with, it’s time to dive into some prompt engineering techniques. In this section, you’ll learn how to apply the following techniques to your prompts to get the desired output from the language model:\\n\\n- **Zero-shot prompting:** Giving the language model normal instructions without any additional context\\n- **Few-shot prompting:** Conditioning the model on a few examples to boost its performance\\n- **Using delimiters:** Adding special tokens or phrases to provide structure and instructions to the model\\n- **Detailed, numbered steps:** Breaking down a complex prompt into a series of small, specific steps\\n\\n\\nBy practicing these techniques with the customer chat conversation example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how prompt engineering can enhance the capabilities of language models and improve their usefulness in real-world applications.\\n\\n### Describe Your Task[](#describe-your-task \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ll start your prompt engineering journey with a concept called **zero-shot prompting**, which is just a fancy way of saying that you’re asking a question or describing a task:\\n> Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date, and replace all swear words with “😤”\\n\\nThis task description focuses on the requested steps for sanitizing the customer chat conversation and literally spells them out. This is the prompt that’s currently saved as `instruction_prompt` in the `settings.toml` file:\\n\\nIf you run the Python script and provide the support chat file as an argument, then it’ll send this prompt together with the content of `chats.txt` to OpenAI’s text completion API:\\n\\nIf you correctly installed the dependencies and added your OpenAI API key as an environment variable, then all you need to do is wait until you see the API response pop up in your terminal:\\n\\nIn the example output, you can see that the prompt that you provided didn’t do a good job tackling the tasks. And that’s putting it gently! It picked up that it should do something with the huffing emoji and reduce the [ISO date-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) to only a date. Your results might not have tackled all of that. Overall, nearly all of the work is left undone and the output is useless.\\n\\nIf you’re new to interacting with LLMs, then this may have been a first attempt at outsourcing your development work to the text completion model. But these initial results aren’t exactly exhilarating.\\n\\nSo you’ve described the task in natural language and gotten a bad result. But don’t fret—throughout the tutorial you’ll learn how you can get more useful responses for your task.\\n\\nOne way to do that is by increasing the number of **shots**, or examples, that you give to the model. When you’ve given the model zero shots, the only way to go is up! That’s why you’ll improve your results through **few-shot prompting** in the next section.\\n\\n### Use Few-Shot Prompting to Improve Output[](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nFew-shot prompting is a prompt engineering technique where you provide example tasks and their expected solutions in your prompt. So, instead of just describing the task like you did before, you’ll now add an example of a chat conversation and its sanitized version.\\n\\nOpen up `settings.toml` and change your `instruction_prompt` by adding such an example:\\n\\nOnce you’ve applied the change, give the LLM another chance to sanitize the chat conversations for you by running the script again:\\n\\nYou’ll have to wait for the LLM to predict all the tokens. When it’s done, you’ll see a fresh response pop up in your terminal:\\n\\nOkay, great! This time at least the LLM didn’t eat up all the information that you passed to it without giving anything useful back!\\n\\nThis time, the model tackled some of the tasks. For example, it sanitized the names in square brackets. However, the names of the customers are still visible in the actual conversations. It also didn’t censor the order numbers or the email address.\\n\\nThe model probably didn’t sanitize any of the names in the conversations or the order numbers because the chat that you provided didn’t contain any names or order numbers. In other words, the output that you provided didn’t show an example of redacting names, order numbers, or email addresses in the conversation text.\\n\\nHere you can see how important it is to choose good examples that clearly represent the output that you want.\\n\\nSo far, you’ve provided *one* example in your prompt. To cover more ground, you’ll add another example so that this part of your prompt truly puts the *few* in few-shot prompting:\\n\\nYou added a second example that contains both a customer name as well as an order number in the chat text body. The example of a sanitized chat shows both types of sensitive data replaced with a sequence of asterisks (`****`). Now you’ve given the LLM a good example to *model*.\\n\\nAfter editing `instruction_prompt` in `settings.toml`, run your script again and wait for the response to print to your terminal:\\n\\nWait? Where did most of the output go? You probably expected to see better results, but it looks like you’re getting only two of the conversations back this time!\\n\\nYou’ve added more text to your prompt. At this point, the task instructions probably make up proportionally too few tokens for the model to consider them in a meaningful way. The model lost track of what it was supposed to do with the text that you provided.\\n\\nAdding more examples should make your responses stronger instead of eating them up, so what’s the deal? You can trust that few-shot prompting works—it’s a widely used and very effective prompt engineering technique. To help the model distinguish which part of your prompt contains the instructions that it should follow, you can use *delimiters*.\\n\\n### Use Delimiters to Clearly Mark Sections of Your Prompt[](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you’re working with content that needs specific inputs, or if you provide examples like you did in the previous section, then it can be very helpful to clearly mark specific sections of the prompt. Keep in mind that everything you write arrives to an LLM as a single prompt—a long sequence of tokens.\\n\\nYou can improve the output by using delimiters to fence and label specific parts of your prompt. In fact, if you’ve been running the example code, then you’ve already used delimiters to fence the content that you’re reading from file.\\n\\nThe script adds the delimiters when assembling the prompt in `app.py`:\\n\\nIn line 13, you wrap the chat content in between `>>>>>` and `<<<<<` delimiters. Marking parts of your prompt with delimiters can help the model keep track of which tokens it should consider as a single unit of meaning.\\n\\nYou’ve seen in the previous section that missing delimiters can lead to unexpected results. You might receive less output than expected, like in the previous example, or an empty response. But you might also receive output that’s quite different from what you want! For example, imagine that the chat content that you’re reformatting contains a question at the end, such as:\\n> Can you give me your order number?\\n\\nIf this question is the last line of your prompt without delimiters, then the LLM might continue the imaginary chat conversation by answering the question with an imaginary order number. Give it a try by adding such a sentence to the end of your current prompt!\\n\\nDelimiters can help to separate the content and examples from the task description. They can also make it possible to refer to specific parts of your prompt at a later point in the prompt.\\n\\nA delimiter can be any **sequence of characters** that usually *wouldn’t* appear together, for example:\\n\\n- `>>>>>`\\n- `====`\\n- `####`\\n\\n\\nThe number of characters that you use doesn’t matter too much, as long as you make sure that the sequence is relatively unique. Additionally, you can add labels just before or just after the delimiters:\\n\\n- `START CONTENT>>>>>` content `<<<<<END CONTENT`\\n- `==== START` content `END ====`\\n- `#### START EXAMPLES` examples `#### END EXAMPLES`\\n\\n\\nThe exact formatting also doesn’t matter so much. As long as you mark the sections so that a casual reader could understand where a unit of meaning begins and ends, then you’ve properly applied delimiters.\\n\\nEdit your prompt in `settings.toml` to add a clear reference to your delimited content, and also include a delimiter for the examples that you’ve added:\\n\\nWith these adaptations to your `instruction_prompt`, you now specifically reference the content as `>>>>>CONTENT<<<<<` in your task description. These delimiters match the delimiters that the code in `app.py` adds when assembling the prompt.\\n\\nYou’ve also delimited the examples that you’re providing with `#### START EXAMPLES` and `#### END EXAMPLES`, and you differentiate between the inputs and expected outputs using multiple dashes (`------`) as delimiters.\\n\\nWhile delimiters can help you to get better results, in this case your output is quite similar to before:\\n\\nIt’s noticeable that the model only shows the two example data that you passed as examples. Could it be that your prompt leads to something similar like [overfitting](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/#underfitting-and-overfitting)? Using the actual data that you want to sanitize as your training data is, anyway, not a good idea, so in the next section, you’ll make sure to change that.\\n\\nIn this section, you’ve learned how you can clarify the different parts of your prompt using delimiters. You marked which part of the prompt is the task description and which part contains the customer support chat conversations, as well as the examples of original input and expected sanitized output.\\n\\n### Test Your Prompt Across Different Data[](#test-your-prompt-across-different-data \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nSo far, you’ve created your few-shot examples from the same data that you also run the sanitation on. This means that you’re effectively using your test data to provide context to the model. Mixing training, validation, and testing data is a bad practice in machine learning. You might wonder how well your prompt generalizes to different input.\\n\\nTo test this out, run the script another time with the same prompt using the second file that contains chat conversations, `testing-chats.txt`. The conversations in this file contain different names, and different—soft—swear words:\\n\\nYou’ll keep running your script using `testing-chats.txt` moving forward, unless indicated differently.\\n\\nOnce you’ve waited for the LLM to generate and return the response, you’ll notice that the result isn’t very satisfying:\\n\\nThe model now understands that you meant the examples as examples to follow when applying edits and gives you back all of the new input data. However, it didn’t do a great job following the instructions.\\n\\nThe model didn’t identify new swear words and didn’t replace them. The model also didn’t redact the order numbers, nor did it anonymize the names. It looks like it only managed to reformat your date strings.\\n\\nSo your engineered prompt currently doesn’t work well, and generalizes even worse. If you built a pipeline based on this prompt, where new chats could contain new customer names, then the application would probably continue to perform poorly. How can you fix that?\\n\\nYou’ve grown your prompt significantly by providing more examples, but your task description is still largely just the question that you wrote right at the beginning. To get better results, you’ll need to do some prompt engineering on the task description as well.\\n\\n### Describe Your Request in Numbered Steps[](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you break up your task instructions into a numbered sequence of small steps, then the model is a lot more likely to produce the results that you’re looking for.\\n\\nGo back to your prompt in `settings.toml` and break your initial task description into more granular, specific substeps:\\n\\nWith these step-by-step instructions in place, you’re ready for another run of your script and another inspection of the newly generated output:\\n\\nThat’s a significant improvement! The model managed to follow the pattern of replacing the names in square brackets with `[Agent]` and `[Customer]`, respectively. It correctly identified some new swear words and replaced them with the huffing emoji. The model also redacted the order numbers, and anonymized the names in the conversation texts.\\n\\nOften, one of the best approaches to get better results from an LLM is to make your instructions more specific.\\n\\nFraming your tasks in even smaller and more specific steps, will generally get you better results. Don’t shy away from [some repetition](https://twitter.com/phillip_isola/status/1532189616106881027):\\n\\nIncreasing the specificity of your instructions, and introducing numbered steps, helped you create a well-performing prompt. Your prompt successfully removes personally identifiable information from the conversations, redacts swear words, and reformats the ISO date-time stamp, as well as the usernames.\\n\\nYou could consider your initial task as completed, but there’s more that you want to do, and more prompt engineering techniques to explore. You also know that there are newer models that you could work with, and your success has further piqued your curiosity. It’s time to switch to a different LLM, see how that influences your output, and then continue exploring other techniques.\\n\\n## Perform Chat Completions With GPT-4[](#perform-chat-completions-with-gpt-4 \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ve decided to switch to an even more powerful LLM, GPT-4. In the rest of this tutorial, you’ll use GPT-4 to continue exploring other important prompt engineering techniques:\\n\\n1. **Role prompting**: Using a system message to set the tone of the conversation, and using different roles to give context through labeling\\n2. **Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT)**: Giving the model time to think by prompting it to reason about a task, then including the reasoning in the prompt\\n\\n\\nYou’ll also use GPT-4 to **classify the sentiment** of each chat conversation and structure the output format as **JSON**.\\n\\n### Switch to a Different Model[](#switch-to-a-different-model \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIf you’re working with the provided script, then all you need to do is pick a chat model from `chat_models` in `settings.toml` and use it as the new value for `model`:\\n\\nChanging these settings will send your request to a different model. Like before, it’ll assemble your prompt in the way necessary for a `/chat/completions` endpoint request, make that request for you, and print the response to your terminal.\\n\\nFor the rest of this tutorial, you’ll work with OpenAI’s latest version of the GPT-4 model. If you don’t have access to this model, then you can instead keep working with the model that you’ve been working with so far.\\n\\nIf you’ve been following along using ChatGPT, then you’re stuck with whatever model currently powers it. Unless you’re a [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) subscriber, then you can [change the model to GPT-4](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7127997-how-can-i-use-gpt-4-in-chatgpt) on the website.\\n\\nWithout changing your prompt, run your script another time to see the different results of the text completion based only on using a different LLM:\\n\\nSome responses may be relatively similar to the ones with the older model. However, you can also expect to receive results like the one shown above, where most swear words are still present.\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that developing for a specific model will lead to specific results, and swapping the model may improve or deteriorate the responses that you get. Therefore, swapping to a newer and more powerful model won’t necessarily give you better results straight away.\\n\\nAdditionally, it’s also helpful to keep in mind that API calls to larger models will generally [cost more money per request](https://openai.com/pricing). While it can be fun to always use the latest and greatest LLM, it may be worthwhile to consider whether you really need to upgrade to tackle the task that you’re trying to solve.\\n\\n### Add a Role Prompt to Set the Tone[](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nThere are some additional possibilities when interacting with the API endpoint that you’ve only used implicitly, but haven’t explored yet, such as adding **role labels** to a part of the prompt. In this section, you’ll use the `\\\"system\\\"` role to create a system message, and you’ll revisit the concept later on when you [add more roles](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) to improve the output.\\n\\n**Role prompting** usually refers to adding system messages, which represent information that helps to set the context for upcoming completions that the model will produce. System messages usually aren’t visible to the end user. Keep in mind that the `/chat/completions` endpoint models were initially designed for conversational interactions.\\n\\nYou can also use system messages to set a context for your completion task. You’ll craft a bespoke role prompt in a moment. However, for this specific task, the role prompt is likely less important than it might be for some other tasks. To explore the possible influence of a role prompt, you’ll take a little detour and ask your model to play a role:\\n\\nYou keep `instruction_prompt` the same as you engineered it earlier in the tutorial. Additionally, you now add text to `role_prompt`. The role prompt shown above serves as an example for the impact that a misguided prompt can have on your application.\\n\\nUnleash, thou shall, the parchment’s code and behold the marvels unexpected, as the results may stir wonderment and awe:\\n\\nAs you can see, a role prompt can have quite an impact on the language that the LLM uses to construct the response. This is great if you’re building a conversational agent that should speak in a certain tone or language. And you can also use system messages to keep specific setup information present.\\n\\nFor completion tasks like the one that you’re currently working on, you might, however, not need this type of role prompt. For now, you could give it a common boilerplate phrase, such as *You’re a helpful assistant*.\\n\\nTo practice writing a role prompt—and to see whether you can release your customer chat conversations from the reign of that 16th century villain poet—you’ll craft a more appropriate role prompt:\\n\\nThis role prompt is more appropriate to your use case. You don’t want the model to introduce randomness or to change any of the language that’s used in the conversations. Instead, you just want it to execute the tasks that you describe. Run the script another time and take a look at the results:\\n\\nThat looks much better again! Abide concealed in yonder bygone era, ye villainous poet!\\n\\nAs you can see from these examples, role prompts can be a powerful way to change your output. Especially if you’re using the LLM to build a conversational interface, then they’re a force to consider.\\n\\nFor some reason, GPT-4 seems to consistently pick `[Client]` over `[Customer]`, even though you’re specifying `[Customer]` in the few-shot examples. You’ll eventually get rid of these verbose names, so it doesn’t matter for your use case.\\n\\nHowever, if you’re determined and curious—and manage to prompt `[Client]` away—then share the prompt that worked for you in the comments.\\n\\nIn the final section of this tutorial, you’ll revisit using roles and see how you can employ [the power of conversation](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) to improve your output even in a non-conversational completion task like the one you’re working on.\\n\\n### Classify the Sentiment of Chat Conversations[](#classify-the-sentiment-of-chat-conversations \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve engineered a decent prompt that seems to perform quite well in sanitizing and reformatting the provided customer chat conversations. To fully grasp the power of LLM-assisted workflows, you’ll next tackle the tacked-on request by your manager to also classify the conversations as positive or negative.\\n\\nStart by saving both sanitized conversation files into new files that will constitute the new inputs for your sentiment classification task:\\n\\nYou could continue to build on top of the previous prompt, but eventually you’ll hit a wall when you’re asking the model to do too many edits at once. The classification step is conceptually distinct from the text sanitation, so it’s a good cut-off point to start a new pipeline.\\n\\nThe sanitized chat conversation files are also included in the example codebase:\\n\\nAgain, you want the model to do the work for you. All you need to do is craft a prompt that spells out the task at hand, and provide examples. You can also edit the role prompt to set the context for this new task that the model should perform:\\n\\nYou can now run the script and provide it with the sanitized conversations in `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` that were the output of your previously engineered prompt:\\n\\nYou added another step to your task description and slightly modified the few-shot examples in your prompt. Not a lot of extra work for a task that would have required a lot more work without the help of an LLM. But is this really sufficient? Take a look at the output once your script has finished running:\\n\\nThe output is quite promising! The model correctly labeled conversations with angry customers with the fire emoji. However, the first conversation probably doesn’t entirely fit into the same bucket as the rest because the customer doesn’t display a negative sentiment towards the company.\\n\\nAssume that all of these conversations were resolved positively by the customer service agents and that your company just wants to follow up with those customers who seemed noticeably angry with their situation. In that case, you might need to tweak your prompt a bit more to get the desired result.\\n\\nYou could [add more examples](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output), which is generally a good idea because it creates more context for the model to apply. Writing a [more detailed description](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps) of your task helps as well, as you’ve seen before. However, to tackle this task, you’ll learn about another useful prompt engineering technique called *chain-of-thought* prompting.\\n\\n### Walk the Model Through Chain-of-Thought Prompting[](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nA widely successful prompt engineering approach can be summed up with the [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) of *giving the model time to think*. You can do this with a couple of different specific techniques. Essentially, it means that you prompt the LLM to produce intermediate results that become additional inputs. That way, the reasoning doesn’t need to take distant leaps but only hop from one lily pad to the next.\\n\\nOne of these approaches is to use **chain-of-thought (CoT)** prompting techniques. To apply CoT, you prompt the model to generate intermediate results that then become part of the prompt in a second request. The increased context makes it more likely that the model will arrive at a useful output.\\n\\nThe smallest form of CoT prompting is **zero-shot CoT**, where you literally ask the model to *think step by step*. This approach yields [impressive results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) for mathematical tasks that LLMs otherwise often solve incorrectly.\\n\\nChain-of-thought operations are technically split into two stages:\\n\\n1. **Reasoning extraction**, where the model generates the increased context\\n2. **Answer extraction**, where the model uses the increased context to generate the answer\\n\\n\\nReasoning extraction is useful across a variety of CoT contexts. You can generate few-shot examples from input, which you can then use for a separate step of extracting answers using more detailed chain-of-thought prompting.\\n\\nYou can try zero-shot CoT on the sanitized chat conversations to embellish the few-shot examples that you’ll use to classify the chat conversations more robustly. Remove the examples and replace the instructions describing the reasoning on how you would classify the conversations in more detail:\\n\\nYou spelled out the criteria that you want the model to use to assess and classify sentiment. Then you add the sentence *Let’s think step by step* to the end of your prompt.\\n\\nYou want to use this zero-shot CoT approach to generate few-shot examples that you’ll then build into your final prompt. Therefore, you should run the script using the data in `sanitized-chats.txt` this time:\\n\\nYou’ll get back a reference to the conversations, with the reasoning spelled out step by step to reach the final conclusion:\\n\\nThe reasoning is straightforward and sticks to your instructions. If the instructions accurately represent the criteria for marking a conversation as positive or negative, then you’ve got a good playbook at hand.\\n\\nYou can now use this information to improve the few-shot examples for your sentiment classification task:\\n\\nYou’re using the same examples as previously, but you’ve enhanced each of the examples with a short chain of thought that you generated in the previous call. Give your script another spin using `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` as the input file and see whether the results have improved:\\n\\nGreat! Now the first conversation, which was initially classified as negative, has also received the green checkmark.\\n\\nIn this section, you’ve supported your examples with reasoning for why a conversation should be labeled as positive vs negative. You generated this reasoning with another call to the LLM.\\n\\nAt this point, it seems that your prompt generalizes well to the available data and classifies the conversations as intended. And you only needed to carefully craft your words to make it happen!\\n\\n### Structure Your Output Format as JSON[](#structure-your-output-format-as-json \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nAs a final showcase for effective prompting when incorporating an LLM into your workflow, you’ll tackle the last task, which you added to the list youself: to pass the data on in a structured format that’ll make it straightforward for the customer support team to process further.\\n\\nYou already specified a format to follow in the previous prompt, and the LLM returned what you asked for. So it might just be a matter of asking for a different, more structured format, for example [JSON](https://realpython.com/python-json/):\\n\\nIn your updated `instruction_prompt`, you’ve explicitly asked the model to return the output as valid JSON. Then, you also adapted your few-shot examples to represent the JSON output that you want to receive. Note that you also applied additional formatting by removing the date from each line of conversation and truncating the `[Agent]` and `[Customer]` labels to single letters, `A` and `C`.\\n\\nYou’re still using example chat conversations from your sanitized chat data in `sanitized-chats.txt`, and you send the sanitized testing data from `sanitized-testing-chats.txt` to the model for processing.\\n\\nIn this case, you receive valid JSON, as requested. The classification still works as before and the output censors personally identifiable information, replaces swear words, and applies all the additional requested formatting:\\n\\nYour output may be different and show some small hiccups, but overall, this output is quite impressive and useful! You could pass this JSON structure over to the customer support team, and they could quickly integrate it into their workflow to follow up with customers who displayed a negative sentiment in the chat conversation.\\n\\nYou could stop here, but the engineer in you isn’t quite satisfied yet. All the instructions just in a single prompt? Your premonition calls and tells you tales about maintainability. In the next section, you’ll refactor your prompts to apply role labels before you set up your LLM-assisted pipeline and call it a day.\\n\\n### Improve Your Output With the Power of Conversation[](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou added a [role prompt](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone) earlier on, but otherwise you haven’t tapped into the power of *conversations* yet.\\n\\nIn this final section, you’ll learn how you can provide additional context to the model by splitting your prompt into multiple separate messages with different labels.\\n\\nIn calls to the `/chat/completions` endpoint, a prompt is split into several **messages**. Each message has its content, which represents the prompt text. Additionally, it also has a **role**. There are [different roles](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-role) that a message can have, and you’ll work with three of them:\\n\\n1. `\\\"system\\\"` gives context for the conversation and helps to set the overall tone.\\n2. `\\\"user\\\"` represents the input that a user of your application might provide.\\n3. `\\\"assistant\\\"` represents the output that the model would reply with.\\n\\n\\nSo far, you’ve provided context for different parts of your prompt all mashed together in a single prompt, more or less well separated [using delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt). When you use a model that’s optimized for chat, such as GPT-4, then you can use roles to let the LLM know what type of message you’re sending.\\n\\nFor example, you can create some variables for your few-shot examples and separate variables for the associated CoT reasoning and outputs:\\n\\nYou’ve disassembled your `instruction_prompt` into seven separate prompts, based on what role the messages have in your conversation with the LLM.\\n\\nThe helper function that builds a messages payload, `_assemble_chat_messages()`, is already set up to include all of these prompts in the API request. Take a look into `app.py` to check out the separate messages, with their fitting roles, that make up your overall prompt:\\n\\nYour prompt is now split into distinct parts, each of which has a certain role label:\\n\\n- **Example input** has the `\\\"user\\\"` role.\\n- **Reasoning** that the model created has the `\\\"system\\\"` role.\\n- **Example output** has the `\\\"assistant\\\"` role.\\n\\n\\nYou’re now providing context for how user input might look, how the model can reason about classifying the input, and how your expected output should look. You removed the delimiters that you previously used for labeling the example sections. They aren’t necessary now that you’re providing context for the parts of your prompt through separate messages.\\n\\nGive your script a final run to see whether the power of conversation has managed to improve the output:\\n\\nThis JSON structure is looking legitimately great! The formatting that you wanted now shows up throughout, and the conversations are labeled correctly.\\n\\nAdditionally, you’ve improved the maintainability of your prompts by splitting them into separate labels. You can feel proud to pass on such a useful edit of the customer chat conversation data to your coworkers!\\n\\n## FAQs[](#faqs \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nYou’ve covered common prompt engineering techniques, and here, you’ll find a few questions and answers that sum up the most important concepts that you’ve covered in this tutorial.\\n\\nYou can use these questions to check your understanding or to recap and solidify what you’ve just learned. After each question, you’ll find a brief explanation hidden in a collapsible section. Click the *Show/Hide* toggle to reveal the answer. Time to dive in!\\n\\nKnowledge about prompt engineering is crucial when you work with large language models (LLMs) because you can receive [much better results](#describe-your-request-in-numbered-steps) with carefully crafted prompts.\\n\\nThe `temperature` setting controls the [amount of randomness](#freeze-responses-by-setting-the-temperature-to-zero) in your output. Setting the `temperature` argument of API calls to `0` will increase consistency in the responses from the LLM. Note that OpenAI’s LLMs are only ever *mostly* deterministic, even with the temperature set to `0`.\\n\\n[Few-shot prompting](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output) is a common prompt engineering technique where you add examples of expected input and desired output to your prompt.\\n\\n[Using delimiters](#use-delimiters-to-clearly-mark-sections-of-your-prompt) can be helpful when dealing with more complex prompts. Delimiters help to separate and label sections of the prompt, assisting the LLM in understanding its tasks better.\\n\\n[Testing your prompt](#test-your-prompt-across-different-data) with data that’s separate from the training data is important to see how well the model generalizes to new conditions.\\n\\nYes, generally adding more context will lead to more accurate results. However, it’s also important *how* you add the additional context. [Just adding more text](#use-few-shot-prompting-to-improve-output) may lead to worse results.\\n\\n[Role prompting](#add-a-role-prompt-to-set-the-tone) means providing a system message that sets the tone or context for a conversation. This can greatly impact how the model constructs the response. You can also [use roles to provide context labels](#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) for parts of your prompt.\\n\\nIn [chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](#walk-the-model-through-chain-of-thought-prompting), you prompt the LLM to produce intermediate reasoning steps. You can then include these steps in the answer extraction step to receive better results.\\n\\n## Next Steps[](#next-steps \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you’ve learned about various prompt engineering techniques, and you’ve built an LLM-assisted Python application along the way. If you’d like to learn more about prompt engineering, then check out some related questions, as well as some resources for further study below:\\n\\nYes, prompt engineer can be a real job, especially in the context of AI and machine learning. As a prompt engineer, you design and optimize prompts so that AI models like GPT-4 produce desired responses. However, it might not be a stand-alone job title everywhere. It could be a part of broader roles like [machine learning](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/machine-learning-python/) engineer or [data scientist](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/data-science-python-core-skills/).\\n\\nPrompt engineering, like any other technical skill, requires time, effort, and practice to learn. It’s not necessarily easy, but it’s certainly possible for someone with the right mindset and resources to learn it. If you’ve enjoyed the iterative and text-based approach that you learned about [in this tutorial](#understand-the-purpose-of-prompt-engineering), then prompt engineering might be a good fit for you.\\n\\nThe field of prompt engineering is quite new, and LLMs keep developing quickly as well. The landscape, best practices, and most effective approaches are therefore changing rapidly. To continue learning about prompt engineering using free and open-source resources, you can check out [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro/) and the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/).\\n\\nHave you found any interesting ways to incorporate an LLM into your workflow?

You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[Prompt Engineering: A Practical Example](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\n**Interactive Quiz**\\n\\n[Practical Prompt Engineering](/quizzes/practical-prompt-engineering/)\\n\\nIn this quiz, you'll test your understanding of prompt engineering techniques with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. You'll revisit how to work with OpenAI's API, apply prompt engineering techniques to practical examples, and use various strategies to improve your results.\\n\\n========================\\nLLMs like ChatGPT are very effective at code generation. In this section, we will cover many examples of how to use ChatGPT for code generation.\\n\\nThe OpenAI's Playground (Chat Mode) and the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model are used for all examples below.\\n\\nAs with all chat models from OpenAI, you can use a `System Message` to define the behavior and format of the responses. We will use the following System Message for the prompt examples:\\n\\n## Basic Example[](#basic-example)\\n\\nThe `User Message` will then be the prompt itself with the instruction of the specific code you want the model to generate. Below is a snapshot of the first basic prompt for code generation. Note that the final code was generated by the `Assistant`.\\n\\n![CODE1](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchat-mode.3928920f.png&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nHere is the prompt if you want to try it yourself:\\n\\n## Turn Comments Into Code[](#turn-comments-into-code)\\n\\nYou can also use the code generation capabilities of these LLMs to generate code from comments alone. Let's look at another example that passes the instructions as a comment block:\\n\\n*Prompt:*\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\nThe generated code looks like working code. However, the output doesn't contain an important `import` statement, i.e., `import json`. While these models generate working code, you must pay close attention to small details like this and always make sure to test your code.\\n\\n## Complete Functions or Next Line[](#complete-functions-or-next-line)\\n\\nThese LLMs have also been incorporated into tools like GitHub Copilot which makes them useful for developers. One useful feature is the ability of the model to complete functions.\\n\\n*Prompt:*\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\n## MySQL Query Generation[](#mysql-query-generation)\\n\\nBesides the basic code generation example above, you can use the model to generate useful code that could be used in other aspects of programming like creating and testing MySQL queries.\\n\\nLet's say you have a dataset with some information which you can include as part of the prompt and then instruct it to generate a specific query. For example:\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\nThe model generates a query! However, in this example we made up the database so we don't have a database to test the generated query. If you are testing this example, it could be useful to have this database created. Fortunately, you can use ChatGPT to generate this for you as well. One approach is using a modified version of the prompt above with slightly different instructions to generate a database schema:\\n\\nThe model generated the following schema:\\n\\nYou can create a temporary database using something like [sqliteonline.com (opens in a new tab)](https://sqliteonline.com/).\\n\\nYou will also need dummy data to test if the original generated query was valid. Let's use ChatGPT for this too! The prompt could look something like the following:\\n\\nThe output with the insert statements:\\n\\nNow that you have the database and the dummy data, you can test the original query. Based on the dummy data, the result should be two rows with `Jane Doe` and `John Doe`.\\n\\n## Explain Code[](#explain-code)\\n\\nIf you are learning to program in a certain language, it might be useful to prompt the model to explain certain bits of code. Let's reuse the query generated above and ask the model to explain it.\\n\\nIf you are using the same System Message from before, be careful of how you are instructing the model. For example, if we use the following example, the model will complain that it is a code assistant in Python but it still provides an explanation. Sometimes the model refuses to generate what you are instructing because it's designed to follow the System Message.\\n\\n*Prompt:*\\n\\n*Output:*\\n\\n## Editing Code[](#editing-code)\\n\\nExample coming soon!\\n\\n## Debugging Code[](#debugging-code)\\n\\nExample coming soon!\\n\\n## Best practices[](#best-practices)\\n\\nComing soon!\\n\\n[![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQgMjQiIHN0cm9rZT0iY3VycmVudENvbG9yIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIj48cGF0aCBzdHJva2UtbGluZWNhcD0icm91bmQiIHN0cm9rZS13aWR0aD0iMiIgc3Ryb2tlLWxpbmVqb2luPSJyb3VuZCIgZD0iTTkgNWw3IDctNyA3IiAvPjwvc3ZnPg==)Tackling Generated Datasets Diversity](/applications/generating_textbooks \\\"Tackling Generated Datasets Diversity\\\")[Graduate Job Classification Case Study![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBmaWxsPSJub25lIiBzdHJva2U9ImN1cnJlbnRDb2xvciIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDI0IDI0Ij48cGF0aCBzdHJva2UtbGluZWNhcD0icm91bmQiIHN0cm9rZS1saW5lam9pbj0icm91bmQiIHN0cm9rZS13aWR0aD0iMiIgZD0iTTkgNWw3IDctNyA3IiAvPjwvc3ZnPg==)](/applications/workplace_casestudy \\\"Graduate Job Classification Case Study\\\")\\n\\n========================\\nAmazon Q Developer provides automatic code generation, auto-completion, and natural language\\n code suggestions.

The payment service is down, and the AI-generated script that was supposed to handle failovers isn't working. The code looked perfect in development. It passed all the tests. But now it's failing because it hardcoded an API key, doesn't handle AWS credential rotation, and has no audit logging for compliance.\\n\\nThis happens more than anyone wants to admit. [Industry research](https://itrevolution.com/articles/new-research-reveals-ai-coding-assistants-boost-developer-productivity-by-26-what-it-leaders-need-to-know/) shows AI coding assistants boost developer productivity by 26%. But here's the problem: [45% of AI-generated code](https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/) contains security vulnerabilities. Most companies are getting faster at building broken software.\\n\\nThe real issue isn't with AI itself. It's that everyone's using the wrong prompts.\\n\\nThink about how most developers use AI coding tools. They type something like \\\"write a Python script to process payments\\\" and expect magic. What they get is code that works in a demo but falls apart in production. It's like asking someone to build you a car and being surprised when they hand you a go-kart.\\n\\nEnterprise software is different. It needs to handle authentication, logging, error recovery, compliance, and integration with systems that were built when Python was still a snake. Most AI prompts don't even mention these requirements.\\n\\nHere's what's counterintuitive: the solution isn't better AI models. It's better prompts. The difference between a prompt that generates toy code and one that generates production-ready code isn't the AI. It's the human who wrote the prompt.\\n\\nEvery large company has the same problem. Developers generate code fast, but it doesn't work in production. The AI creates beautiful functions that assume perfect network conditions, unlimited memory, and no security requirements.\\n\\nReal enterprise code is mostly error handling and edge cases. It's checking if services are down, rotating credentials, masking sensitive data, and logging everything for audits. A payment processing function in a real company spends more time dealing with failures than processing payments.\\n\\nBut look at typical AI prompts. They're all happy path scenarios. \\\"Write a function to connect to a database\\\" never mentions connection pooling, credential rotation, or what happens when the database is unavailable. The AI generates code that works once and breaks forever.\\n\\nThis creates a weird dynamic. Developers feel productive because they're writing code fast. Managers see features shipping quickly. But operations teams know the truth. They're the ones getting called at night when the pretty AI-generated code encounters its first real-world problem.\\n\\nThe gap between development speed and production reliability is growing. Companies are shipping faster than ever while their systems become more fragile. It's like building houses with cardboard because it's quicker than using wood.\\n\\n## **The Context Problem Nobody Talks About**\\n\\nHere's something most people don't understand about AI coding tools. The quality of generated code isn't just about the model. It's about how much context the AI can see.\\n\\nMost AI coding assistants have tiny context windows. They can see maybe a few files at once. But enterprise software isn't a collection of independent files. It's a web of dependencies, shared libraries, configuration systems, and integration patterns that span hundreds of services.\\n\\nWhen an AI can only see a single file, it makes assumptions. It assumes hardcoded values are fine. It assumes simple error handling is enough. It assumes the function will run in isolation. These assumptions kill production systems.\\n\\nThink about it this way. If you asked a new developer to write code without showing them the existing codebase, architecture documentation, or integration patterns, what would you expect? That's essentially what most AI tools are doing.\\n\\n[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) has a 200k token context window. That's 12 times larger than most competitors. It can see entire codebases, understand existing patterns, and generate code that actually fits into real systems. It's like the difference between building a bridge with a blueprint versus guessing what the other side looks like.\\n\\nContext isn't just nice to have. It's the difference between code that works and code that integrates.\\n\\nLet's look at how to write prompts that actually work. The secret is specificity. Don't ask for a payment processor. Ask for a payment processor that handles PCI compliance, retry logic, fraud detection, audit logging, and integration with your existing authentication system.\\n\\nHere's a prompt that generates real enterprise code:\\n\\nNotice what's different? It specifies the Python version, the exact cloud services, the validation library, the encryption method, the monitoring system, and the testing framework. It asks for retry logic and edge case handling. This isn't a toy prompt. It's a specification.\\n\\nThe AI knows to include AWS credential handling because S3 and Redshift are mentioned. It knows to add error logging because CloudWatch metrics are required. It generates proper exception handling because edge cases are explicitly mentioned.\\n\\nCompare that to \\\"write a script to process CSV files.\\\" The AI would generate something that works on your laptop but fails in production. No error handling, no monitoring, no security, no tests.\\n\\nHere's another example for authentication:\\n\\nThis prompt gets enterprise-grade authentication code because it mentions the specific requirements that matter: hierarchical roles, LDAP integration, audit logging, and performance testing. The AI generates code that actually works in a real company.\\n\\nThe pattern is simple. Specify everything that matters for production: security, monitoring, error handling, testing, and integration requirements.\\n\\nLet's go through prompts that generate production-ready code. Each one includes the enterprise requirements that most prompts ignore.\\n\\n**Secure ETL Pipeline with Compliance Monitoring**\\n\\nThis works because it specifies the complete data pipeline with security and monitoring. The AI generates code that handles AWS credentials, encryption keys, network failures, and malformed data. It's not just an ETL script. It's an enterprise ETL system.\\n\\n**SOC 2 Audit Log Decorator Framework**\\n\\nCompliance isn't optional in enterprise software. This prompt generates a logging system that meets audit requirements. The AI includes sensitive data masking, correlation IDs, and proper error handling because the prompt mentions SOC 2 compliance.\\n\\n**Role-Based Access Control with Enterprise Integration**\\n\\nAuthentication in enterprise software is complex. This prompt generates code that integrates with existing directory services and handles the permission hierarchies that real companies need. It's not a toy login system. It's enterprise identity management.\\n\\n**Zero-Downtime Kubernetes Deployment Orchestrator**\\n\\nDeployment automation needs to be bulletproof. This prompt generates code that handles the complexity of Kubernetes deployments, including rollback logic and notification systems. It's production deployment automation that actually works.\\n\\n**PII Detection and GDPR Compliance Processor**\\n\\nPrivacy regulations aren't going away. This prompt generates code that handles the complexity of data privacy, including detection algorithms, masking strategies, and audit trails. It's not just data processing. It's compliant data processing.\\n\\n**Multi-Tenant Logging with Data Isolation**\\n\\nMulti-tenant systems need perfect data isolation. This prompt generates logging infrastructure that prevents data leakage between tenants while maintaining operational visibility. It's enterprise logging that actually works.\\n\\n**Automated Compliance Monitoring Framework**\\n\\nCompliance monitoring can't be manual. This prompt generates automation that continuously validates security controls and generates the reports that auditors need. It's compliance automation that reduces audit overhead.\\n\\n**High-Performance Async API Client Generator**\\n\\nAPI integration in enterprise systems needs to handle failures gracefully. This prompt generates clients with proper connection management, retry logic, and error handling. It's not just an API wrapper. It's resilient integration infrastructure.\\n\\nNotice what all these prompts have in common? They specify the production requirements that toy prompts ignore.\\n\\nEvery prompt mentions specific technologies, not generic concepts. Instead of \\\"database,\\\" they say \\\"Redshift.\\\" Instead of \\\"logging,\\\" they say \\\"CloudWatch Logs.\\\" Instead of \\\"security,\\\" they say \\\"JWT tokens with LDAP integration.\\\"\\n\\nEvery prompt includes error handling and monitoring. Real systems fail, and production code needs to handle failures gracefully. These prompts generate code that assumes failures will happen.\\n\\nEvery prompt mentions testing and validation. Enterprise code without tests is just technical debt waiting to happen. These prompts generate the test coverage that production systems need.\\n\\nEvery prompt includes compliance and security requirements. Enterprise software operates under regulatory constraints that toy examples ignore. These prompts generate code that meets real compliance requirements.\\n\\nThe difference isn't the AI model. It's the specificity of the request.\\n\\nHere's what happens when companies use generic AI prompts. Developers generate code fast, but it creates more problems than it solves.\\n\\nThe code works in development but fails in production. The failure modes are predictable: hardcoded credentials, missing error handling, no audit logging, and poor integration with existing systems. Operations teams spend their time fixing AI-generated code instead of building new features.\\n\\nSecurity teams find vulnerabilities in every release. The AI-generated code doesn't follow security best practices because the prompts don't mention security requirements. Every deployment becomes a security review instead of a routine release.\\n\\nCompliance teams can't audit the systems because the code doesn't generate the logs and reports they need. Simple features become compliance projects because the foundation is wrong.\\n\\nThe productivity gains from AI disappear under the weight of technical debt. Teams move fast initially but slow down as the codebase becomes unmaintainable. It's like driving fast with bad brakes. You go faster until you crash.\\n\\nThe solution isn't avoiding AI. It's using it correctly. Good prompts generate code that integrates with existing systems, follows security best practices, and meets compliance requirements.\\n\\nThink about AI as a very fast junior developer who knows syntax but doesn't understand context. You wouldn't tell a junior developer to \\\"build a payment system\\\" without explaining the requirements, architecture, and constraints. Don't do it with AI either.\\n\\nSpecify everything that matters for production. Mention the exact technologies, security requirements, error handling needs, and integration patterns. The more specific the prompt, the better the generated code.\\n\\nReview everything before deployment. AI-generated code still needs human oversight. Look for security issues, integration problems, and missing error handling. Use the generated code as a starting point, not a finished product.\\n\\nTest comprehensively. AI generates code that passes happy path tests but fails under stress. Test error conditions, security scenarios, and integration edge cases. Production testing reveals problems that development testing misses.\\n\\nMonitor everything in production. AI-generated code fails in unexpected ways. Good monitoring catches problems before they impact users. Plan for failures because they will happen.\\n\\nThe companies that get AI right will build software faster without sacrificing quality. They'll use specific prompts that generate production-ready code instead of toy examples.\\n\\nThe companies that get AI wrong will build technical debt faster than ever. They'll ship broken software quickly and spend years fixing it. The productivity gains will disappear under maintenance overhead.\\n\\nThe difference isn't the AI technology. Every company has access to the same models. The difference is prompt engineering and code review discipline.\\n\\n[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) provides the enterprise capabilities that make this possible: 200k token context windows, SOC 2 Type II certification, and Claude Sonnet 4 integration. But the tool is only as good as the prompts you give it.\\n\\nThe future belongs to companies that understand this distinction. AI is a powerful tool for generating code, but only if you know how to ask for what you actually need.\\n\\nWant to see the difference that enterprise-grade AI coding capabilities make?

By using an automatic formatting tool, a programmer is relieved of\\nthis task and can concentrate on more important things.\\n\\nFurthermore, by sticking to an established style guide (such as this one),\\nprogrammers don't need to formulate ad hoc style rules, nor do they need to\\ndebate with other programmers what style rules should be used, saving time,\\ncommunication overhead, and mental energy.\\n\\nHumans comprehend information through pattern matching. By ensuring that all\\nRust code has similar formatting, less mental effort is required to comprehend a\\nnew project, lowering the barrier to entry for new developers.\\n\\nThus, there are productivity benefits to using a formatting tool (such as`rustfmt`), and even larger benefits by using a community-consistent\\nformatting, typically by using a formatting tool's default settings.\\n\\n## [The default Rust style](#the-default-rust-style)\\n\\nThe Rust Style Guide defines the default Rust style, and *recommends* that\\ndevelopers and tools follow the default Rust style. Tools such as `rustfmt` use\\nthe style guide as a reference for the default style. Everything in this style\\nguide, whether or not it uses language such as \\\"must\\\" or the imperative mood\\nsuch as \\\"insert a space ...\\\" or \\\"break the line after ...\\\", refers to the\\ndefault style.\\n\\nThis should not be interpreted as forbidding developers from following a\\nnon-default style, or forbidding tools from adding any particular configuration\\noptions.\\n\\n## [Bugs](#bugs)\\n\\nIf the style guide differs from rustfmt, that may represent a bug in rustfmt,\\nor a bug in the style guide; either way, please report it to the style team or\\nthe rustfmt team or both, for investigation and fix.\\n\\nIf implementing a new formatting tool based on the style guide and default Rust\\nstyle, please test it on the corpus of existing Rust code, and avoid causing\\nwidespread breakage. The implementation and testing of such a tool may surface\\nbugs in either the style guide or rustfmt, as well as bugs in the tool itself.\\n\\nWe typically resolve bugs in a fashion that avoids widespread breakage.\\n\\n## [Formatting conventions](#formatting-conventions)\\n\\n### [Indentation and line width](#indentation-and-line-width)\\n\\n- Use spaces, not tabs.\\n- Each level of indentation must be 4 spaces (that is, all indentation\\noutside of string literals and comments must be a multiple of 4).\\n- The maximum width for a line is 100 characters.\\n\\n#### [Block indent](#block-indent)\\n\\nPrefer block indent over visual indent:\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        // Block indent\\n        a_function_call(\\n            foo,\\n            bar,\\n        );\\n\\n        // Visual indent\\n        a_function_call(foo,\\n                        bar);\\n        }\\n\\n\\nThis makes for smaller diffs (e.g., if `a_function_call` is renamed in the above\\nexample) and less rightward drift.\\n\\n### [Trailing commas](#trailing-commas)\\n\\nIn comma-separated lists of any kind, use a trailing comma when followed by a\\nnewline:\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        function_call(\\n            argument,\\n            another_argument,\\n        );\\n\\n        let array = [\\n            element,\\n            another_element,\\n            yet_another_element,\\n        ];\\n        }\\n\\n\\nThis makes moving code (e.g., by copy and paste) easier, and makes diffs\\nsmaller, as appending or removing items does not require modifying another line\\nto add or remove a comma.\\n\\n### [Blank lines](#blank-lines)\\n\\nSeparate items and statements by either zero or one blank lines (i.e., one or\\ntwo newlines). E.g,\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        fn foo() {\\n            let x = ...;\\n\\n            let y = ...;\\n            let z = ...;\\n        }\\n\\n        fn bar() {}\\n        fn baz() {}\\n        }\\n\\n\\n### [Trailing whitespace](#trailing-whitespace)\\n\\nDo not include trailing whitespace on the end of any line. This includes blank\\nlines, comment lines, code lines, and string literals.\\n\\nNote that avoiding trailing whitespace in string literals requires care to\\npreserve the value of the literal.\\n\\n### [Sorting](#sorting)\\n\\nIn various cases, the default Rust style specifies to sort things. If not\\notherwise specified, such sorting should be \\\"version sorting\\\", which ensures\\nthat (for instance) `x8` comes before `x16` even though the character `1` comes\\nbefore the character `8`.\\n\\nFor the purposes of the Rust style, to compare two strings for version-sorting:\\n\\n- Process both strings from beginning to end as two sequences of maximal-length\\nchunks, where each chunk consists either of a sequence of characters other\\nthan ASCII digits, or a sequence of ASCII digits (a numeric chunk), and\\ncompare corresponding chunks from the strings.\\n- To compare two numeric chunks, compare them by numeric value, ignoring\\nleading zeroes. If the two chunks have equal numeric value, but different\\nnumbers of leading digits, and this is the first time this has happened for\\nthese strings, treat the chunks as equal (moving on to the next chunk) but\\nremember which string had more leading zeroes.\\n- To compare two chunks if both are not numeric, compare them by Unicode\\ncharacter lexicographically, with two exceptions:\\n  - `_` (underscore) sorts immediately after  (space) but before any other\\ncharacter. (This treats underscore as a word separator, as commonly used in\\nidentifiers.)\\n  - Unless otherwise specified, version-sorting should sort non-lowercase\\ncharacters (characters that can start an `UpperCamelCase` identifier)\\nbefore lowercase characters.\\n- If the comparison reaches the end of the string and considers each pair of\\nchunks equal:\\n  - If one of the numeric comparisons noted the earliest point at which one\\nstring had more leading zeroes than the other, sort the string with more\\nleading zeroes first.\\n  - Otherwise, the strings are equal.\\n\\n\\nNote that there exist various algorithms called \\\"version sorting\\\", which\\ngenerally try to solve the same problem, but which differ in various ways (such\\nas in their handling of numbers with leading zeroes). This algorithm\\ndoes not purport to precisely match the behavior of any particular other\\nalgorithm, only to produce a simple and satisfying result for Rust formatting.\\nIn particular, this algorithm aims to produce a satisfying result for a set of\\nsymbols that have the same number of leading zeroes, and an acceptable and\\neasily understandable result for a set of symbols that has varying numbers of\\nleading zeroes.\\n\\nAs an example, version-sorting will sort the following strings in the order\\ngiven:\\n\\n- `_ZYXW`\\n- `_abcd`\\n- `A2`\\n- `ABCD`\\n- `Z_YXW`\\n- `ZY_XW`\\n- `ZY_XW`\\n- `ZYXW`\\n- `ZYXW_`\\n- `a1`\\n- `abcd`\\n- `u_zzz`\\n- `u8`\\n- `u16`\\n- `u32`\\n- `u64`\\n- `u128`\\n- `u256`\\n- `ua`\\n- `usize`\\n- `uz`\\n- `v000`\\n- `v00`\\n- `v0`\\n- `v0s`\\n- `v00t`\\n- `v0u`\\n- `v001`\\n- `v01`\\n- `v1`\\n- `v009`\\n- `v09`\\n- `v9`\\n- `v010`\\n- `v10`\\n- `w005s09t`\\n- `w5s009t`\\n- `x64`\\n- `x86`\\n- `x86_32`\\n- `x86_64`\\n- `x86_128`\\n- `x87`\\n- `zyxw`\\n\\n### [](#module-level-items)[Module-level items](items.html)\\n\\n### [](#statements)[Statements](statements.html)\\n\\n### [](#expressions)[Expressions](expressions.html)\\n\\n### [](#types)[Types](types.html)\\n\\nThe following guidelines for comments are recommendations only, a mechanical\\nformatter might skip formatting of comments.\\n\\nPrefer line comments (`//`) to block comments (`/* ... */`).\\n\\nWhen using line comments, put a single space after the opening sigil.\\n\\nWhen using single-line block comments, put a single space after the opening\\nsigil and before the closing sigil. For multi-line block comments, put a\\nnewline after the opening sigil, and a newline before the closing sigil.\\n\\nPrefer to put a comment on its own line. Where a comment follows code, put a\\nsingle space before it. Where a block comment appears inline, use surrounding\\nwhitespace as if it were an identifier or keyword.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        // A comment on an item.\\n        struct Foo { ... }\\n\\n        fn foo() {} // A comment after an item.\\n\\n        pub fn foo(/* a comment before an argument */ x: T) {...}\\n        }\\n\\n\\nComments should usually be complete sentences. Start with a capital letter, end\\nwith a period (`.`). An inline block comment may be treated as a note without\\npunctuation.\\n\\nSource lines which are entirely a comment should be limited to 80 characters\\nin length (including comment sigils, but excluding indentation) or the maximum\\nwidth of the line (including comment sigils and indentation), whichever is\\nsmaller:\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        // This comment goes up to the ................................. 80 char margin.\\n\\n        {\\n            // This comment is .............................................. 80 chars wide.\\n        }\\n\\n        {\\n            {\\n                {\\n                    {\\n                        {\\n                            {\\n                                // This comment is limited by the ......................... 100 char margin.\\n                            }\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        }\\n\\n\\nPrefer line comments (`///`) to block comments (`/** ... */`).\\n\\nPrefer outer doc comments (`///` or `/** ... */`), only use inner doc comments\\n(`//!` and `/*! ... */`) to write module-level or crate-level documentation.\\n\\nPut doc comments before attributes.\\n\\n### [Attributes](#attributes)\\n\\nPut each attribute on its own line, indented to the level of the item.\\nIn the case of inner attributes (`#!`), indent it to the level of the inside of\\nthe item. Prefer outer attributes, where possible.\\n\\nFor attributes with argument lists, format like functions.\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        #[repr(C)]\\n        #[foo(foo, bar)]\\n        #[long_multi_line_attribute(\\n            split,\\n            across,\\n            lines,\\n        )]\\n        struct CRepr {\\n            #![repr(C)]\\n            x: f32,\\n            y: f32,\\n        }\\n        }\\n\\n\\nFor attributes with an equal sign, put a single space before and after the `=`,\\ne.g., `#[foo = 42]`.\\n\\nThere must only be a single `derive` attribute. Note for tool authors: if\\ncombining multiple `derive` attributes into a single attribute, the ordering of\\nthe derived names must generally be preserved for correctness: `#[derive(Foo)] #[derive(Bar)] struct Baz;` must be formatted to `#[derive(Foo, Bar)] struct Baz;`.\\n\\n### [*small* items](#small-items)\\n\\nIn many places in this guide we specify formatting that depends on a code\\nconstruct being *small*. For example, single-line vs multi-line struct\\nliterals:\\n\\n        #![allow(unused)]\\n        fn main() {\\n        // Normal formatting\\n        Foo {\\n            f1: an_expression,\\n            f2: another_expression(),\\n        }\\n\\n        // \\\"small\\\" formatting\\n        Foo { f1, f2 }\\n        }\\n\\n\\nWe leave it to individual tools to decide on exactly what *small* means. In\\nparticular, tools are free to use different definitions in different\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nSome suitable heuristics are the size of the item (in characters) or the\\ncomplexity of an item (for example, that all components must be simple names,\\nnot more complex sub-expressions). For more discussion on suitable heuristics,\\nsee [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/47).\\n\\n## [](#non-formatting-conventions)[Non-formatting conventions](advice.html)\\n\\n## [](#cargotoml-conventions)[Cargo.toml conventions](cargo.html)\\n\\n## [](#principles-used-for-deciding-these-guidelines)[Principles used for deciding these guidelines](principles.html)\\n\\n========================\\nWelcome to an overview of the documentation provided by the [Rust project![SVG Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIC0yNTYgMTg1MCAxODUwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiPgogICAgICAgPGcgdHJhbnNmb3JtPSJtYXRyaXgoMSwwLDAsLTEsMzAsMTQyNykiPgogICAgICAgICA8cGF0aCBkPSJNIDE0MDgsNjA4IFYgMjg4IFEgMTQwOCwxNjkgMTMyMy41LDg0LjUgMTIzOSwwIDExMjAsCiAgICAgICAgICAgMCBIIDI4OCBRIDE2OSwwIDg0LjUsODQuNSAwLDE2OSAwLDI4OCB2IDgzMiBRIDAsMTIzOSA4NC41LDEzMjMuNSAxNjksCiAgICAgICAgICAgMTQwOCAyODgsMTQwOCBoIDcwNCBxIDE0LDAgMjMsLTkgOSwtOSA5L…](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Guide\\n\\n[](#rust-documentation-style-guide)\\n\\nAs [the Rust style guide book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2436-style-guide.html#drawbacks) states:\\n> One can level some criticisms at having a style guide:\\n>\\n> - It is bureaucratic, gives developers more to worry about, and crushes creativity.\\n> - There are edge cases where the style rules make code look worse (e.g., around Foreign Function Interface (FFI)).\\n> However, these are heavily out-weighed by the benefits.\\n\\nThe style guide is based on the best practices collected from the following books:\\n\\n- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/foreword.html)\\n- [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/index.html)\\n- [The rustup book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows.html)\\n- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html)\\n- [The rustc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/targets/index.html)\\n- [The Rust on ESP Book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/)\\n\\n\\n## Contents of This Style

[Documentation](#documentation)\\n  - [Code](#code)\\n\\n\\n## Heading Titles\\n\\n[](#heading-titles)\\n\\nThe books on Rust usually have heading titles based on nouns or gerunds:\\n> **Design Patterns**\\n> **Using Structs to Structure Related Data**\\n\\n### Capitalization\\n\\n[](#capitalization)\\n\\nIn heading titles, capitalize the first letter of every word **except for**:\\n\\n- Articles (a, an, the); unless an article is the first word.\\n> **Defining an Enum**\\n> **A First Attempt at Rust**\\n\\n- Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, or, nor).\\n> **Packages and Crates**\\n\\n- Prepositions of four letters or less; unless these prepositions are the first or last words.\\n\\n  - Prepositions of *five* letters and above should be capitalized (Before, Through, Versus, Among, Under, Between, Without, etc.).\\n> **Peripherals as State Machines**\\n\\nDo not capitalize names of functions, commands, packages, websites, etc.\\n> **What is `rustc`**\\n> **Publishing on crates.io**\\n\\nSee also, the [Using `monospace`](#using-monospace) section.\\n\\nIn hyphenated words, do not capitalize the parts following the hyphens.\\n> **Built-in Targets**\\n> **Allowed-by-default Lints**\\n\\n## Linking\\n\\n[](#linking)\\n\\n### Adding Links\\n\\n[](#adding-links)\\n\\nTo simplify link maintenance, follow the rules below:\\n\\n- Use [link variables](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27784490/10308406) with variable names that give a clue on where the link leads.\\n- Define link variables right before the end of the section/subsection where they are used.\\n\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n    [`espup`][espup-github] is a tool that simplifies installing and maintaining the components required to develop Rust applications.\\n\\n    [espup-github]: https://github.com/esp-rs/espup\\n\\n### Formatting\\n\\n[](#formatting)\\n\\nThe books on Rust usually use the following link formatting:\\n> As mentioned in the [Environment Variables](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html) section.\\n> For more details, see the [Windows](/esp-rs/book/blob/main/rustup-book-windows) chapter in The rustup book.\\n\\n[The Rust Programming Language](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/style-guide.md) book also suggests:\\n\\n- Make intra-book links relative, so they work both online and locally\\n\\n\\nDo *not* turn long phrases into links\\n> ❌ See the [Rust Reference’s section on constant evaluation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html) for more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.\\n\\nAlso, consider the following:\\n\\n- Do not provide a link to the same location repeatedly in the same or adjacent paragraphs without a good reason, especially using different link text.\\n\\n- Do not use the same link text to refer to different locations.\\n> `espup` might have a section in a book and a github repo. In this case, see the [`espup`](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/index.html#risc-v-and-xtensa-targets) section and [`espup` repo](https://github.com/esp-rs/espup).\\n\\nSee also, the [Using `monospace`](#using-monospace) section.\\n\\n## Lists\\n\\n[](#lists)\\n\\n### Types\\n\\n[](#types)\\n\\nThe following types of lists are usually used in documentation:\\n\\n- **Bullet list** -- use it if the order or items is not important\\n- **Numbered list** -- use it if the order of items is important, such as when describing a process\\n  - **Procedure** -- special type of numbered list that gives steps to achieve some goal (to achieve this, do this); for an example of a procedure, see the [Usage](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/profile-guided-optimization.html#usage) section in The rustc book.\\n\\n\\n### Formatting\\n\\n[](#formatting-1)\\n\\nThe books on Rust usually use the following list formatting:\\n\\n- Finish an introductory sentence with a colon.\\n\\n- Capitalize the first letter of each bullet point.\\n> Using C or C++ inside of a Rust project consists of two major parts:\\n>\\n> - Wrapping the exposed C API for use with Rust\\n> - Building your C or C++ code to be integrated with the Rust code\\n\\n- If a bullet point is a full sentence, you can end it with a full stop.\\n\\n  - If a list has at least one full stop, end all other list items with a full stop.\\n> To reliably interact with these peripherals:\\n>\\n> - Always use `volatile` methods to read or write to peripheral memory, as it can change at any time.\\n> - In software, we should be able to share any number of read-only accesses to these peripherals.\\n> - If some software should have read-write access to a peripheral, it should hold the only reference to that peripheral.\\n\\n- For longer list items, consider using a summary word of phrase to make content [scannable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/).\\n> If you run Windows on your host machine, make sure\\n>\\n> - **MSVC**: Recommended ABI, included in\\n> - **GNU**: ABI used by the GCC toolchain\\n  - For an example using bold font, see the list in the [Modules Cheat Sheet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet) section in The Rust Programming Language book.\\n  - For an example using monospace font, see the [Panicking](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/start/panicking.html#panicking) section in The Embedded Rust Book.\\n\\n## Using `monospace`\\n\\n[](#using-monospace)\\n\\nUse monospace font for the following items:\\n\\n- Code snippets\\n\\n  The [Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) chapter in the Rust Programming Language book suggests:\\n\\n  - Start the terminal commands with `$`\\n  - Output of previous commands should not start with `$`\\n  - For PowerShell-specific examples, use `>` instead of `$`\\n\\n  [The Rust Programming Language](https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/book-ja/blob/master-ja/style-guide.md) book also suggests:\\n\\n  - Use `bash` syntax highlighting\\n\\n- Rust declarations: commands, functions, arguments, parameters, flags, variables\\n\\n- In-line command line output\\n> Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`\\n\\n- Data types: `i8`, `u128`\\n\\n- Names of crates, traits, libraries,\\n\\n- Command line tools, plugins, packages\\n\\n- Files: `config.toml`\\n\\n- Images and containers: `idf-rust`\\n\\n### Monospace and Other Types of Formatting\\n\\n[](#monospace-and-other-types-of-formatting)\\n\\nMonospace font can also be used in:\\n\\n- links\\n> [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a string type provided by\\n\\n- headings\\n> **A `no_std` Rust Environment**\\n\\n## Using *Italics*\\n\\n[](#using-italics)\\n\\n- Introduce new terms\\n> Each value in Rust has an *owner*.\\n> A *hash map* allows you to associate a value with a particular key.\\n\\n- Emphasize important concepts or words\\n> When `s` comes *into* scope, it is valid. It remains valid until it goes *out of* scope.\\n\\n- Do *not* use italics with Espressif product names, such as ESP32.\\n\\n## Mode of Narration\\n\\n[](#mode-of-narration)\\n\\n- Use *the first person* (we) when introducing a tutorial or explaining how things will be done. The reader will feel like being on the same team with the authors working side by side.\\n> We'll start writing a program for the LM3S6965, a Cortex-M3 microcontroller. We have chosen this as our initial target because it can be emulated using QEMU so you don't need to fiddle with hardware in this section, and we can focus on the tooling and the development process.\\n\\n- Use *the second person* (you) when describing what the reader should do while installing software, following a tutorial or a procedure.

As alluded to, it is the responsibility of the developer to ensure\\nthat each library crate, public module, public type, and public function is well documented. Below\\nare the expectations for each.\\n\\nIf a common section is not applicable to the documented item, do not include it.\\n\\n### Crate Style Guide[¶](#crate-style-guide \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nCrate documentation should be located at the top of the lib.rs or main.rs file. The intent is to\\ndescribe the purpose of the crate, providing any setup instructions and examples. This is also the\\nplace to describe any common misconceptions or \\\"gotchas\\\". Doc comments here use `//!` specifying\\nwe are documenting the *parent* item (the crate).\\n\\n    //! PE32 Management\\n    //!\\n    //! This library provides high-level functionality for operating on and representing PE32 images.\\n    //!\\n    //! ## Examples and Usage\\n    //!\\n    //! ```\\n    //! let file: File = File::open(test_collateral!(\\\"test_image.pe32\\\"))\\n    //!   .expect(\\\"failed to open test file.\\\");\\n    //!\\n    //! let mut buffer: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();\\n    //! file.read_to_end(&mut buffer).expect(\\\"Failed to read test file\\\");\\n    //!\\n    //! let image_info: Pe32ImageInfo = pe32_get_image_info(buffer).unwrap();\\n    //!\\n    //! let mut loaded_image: Vec<u8> = vec![0; image_info.size_of_image as usize];\\n    //! pe32_load_image(&image, &mut loaded_image).unwrap();\\n    //! ```\\n    //!\\n    //! ## License\\n    //!\\n    //!

SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause-Patent\\n    //!\\n\\n### Module Style Guide[¶](#module-style-guide \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nModule documentation should be placed at the top of a module, whether that be a mod.rs file or the\\nmodule itself if contained to a single file. If a crate only consists of a single module, the crate\\nstyle guide should be used.Submodules should be avoided if possible, as they cause confusion. The\\ngoal is to describe the types found in this module and their interactions with the rest of the\\ncrate. Doc comments here use `//!` specifying we are documenting the *parent* item (the module).\\n\\n    //! PE32 Management\\n    //!\\n    //!

SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause-Patent\\n    //!\\n\\n### Type Style Guide[¶](#type-style-guide \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nType documentation should be available for all public public types such as enums, structs, etc. The\\nfocus should be on the construction of the type (when / how), Destruction of the type if a custom\\nDrop trait is implemented, and any performance concerns. Doc comments here use `///` specifying we\\nare documenting the item directly below it (the type or member of the type).\\n\\n**Document traits, not trait implementations!**\\n\\n    /// Type for describing errors that result from working with PE32 images.\\n    #[derive(Debug)]\\n    pub enum Pe32Error {\\n        /// Goblin failed to parse the PE32 image.\\n        ///\\n        /// See the enclosed goblin error for a reason why the parsing failed.\\n        ParseError(goblin::error::Error),\\n        /// The parsed PE32 image does not contain an Optional Header.\\n        NoOptionalHeader,\\n        /// Failed to load the PE32 image into the provided memory buffer.\\n        LoadError,\\n        /// Failed to relocate the loaded image to the destination.\\n        RelocationError,\\n    }\\n\\n    /// Type containing information about a PE32 image.\\n    #[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]\\n    pub struct Pe32ImageInfo {\\n        /// The offset of the entry point relative to the start address of the PE32 image.\\n        pub entry_point_offset: usize,\\n        /// The subsystem type (IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_BOOT_SERVICE_DRIVER [0xB], etc.).\\n        pub image_type: u16,\\n        /// The total length of the image.\\n        pub size_of_image: u32,\\n        /// The size of an individual section in a power of 2 (4K [0x1000], etc.).\\n        pub section_alignment: u32,\\n        /// The ascii string representation of a file (<filename>.efi).\\n        pub filename: Option<String>,\\n    }\\n\\n### Function Style Guide[¶](#function-style-guide \\\"Permanent link\\\")\\n\\nFunction documentation should be available for functions of a public type (associated functions),\\nand any public functions. At least one example is required for each function in addition to the\\nother sections mentioned below.\\n\\nDo not provide an arguments section, the name and type of the argument should make it self-evident\\n\\nDo not provide a Returns section, this should be captured in the longer description and the return\\ntype makes the possible return value self-evident.\\n\\n    /// Attempts to parse a PE32 image and return information about the image.\\n    ///\\n    /// Parses the bytes buffer containing a PE32 image and generates a [Pe32ImageInfo] struct\\n    /// containing general information about the image otherwise an error.\\n    ///\\n    /// ## Errors\\n    ///\\n    /// Returns [`ParseError`](Pe32Error::ParseError) if parsing the PE32 image failed.

chapter\\\")\\n\\n========================\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis guide focuses on best practices and stylistic conventions for writing Rust code, aiming for code that is not only efficient and safe but also clean, readable, and consistent.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Formatting\\n\\n\\n\\nThe formatting rules for Rust adhere to our [Foundational Formatting Standards](https://styles.goatbytes.io/foundation/#formatting) with the following exceptions:\\n\\n\\n\\n- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.\\n\\n\\nOtherwise, follow the conventions outlined in the foundational standards, summarized below:\\n\\n\\n\\n- **Line Length:** Aim for 100 characters, but allow flexibility for readability.\\n- **Whitespace:** Use spaces around operators, parentheses, braces, colons, commas, and keywords.\\n- **Brace Style:** Follow K&R style (opening brace on same line, closing brace on new line).\\n- **Blank Lines:** Use 1 line to separate code sections.\\n- **Alignment:** Align elements in documentation comments and parameter lists.\\n\\n\\nRemember, these are guidelines; adapt them for your project's needs while keeping readability in focus.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Naming Conventions\\n\\n\\n\\n- **UpperCamelCase (PascalCase)** for types (classes, structs, enums), and enum variants.\\n- **snake_case** for function and method names, local variables, struct fields, macro names, and properties.\\n- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for constants (consts and immutable statics).\\n- **lowercase** for package names, using concatenated words (avoid underscores).\\n- Use a **raw identifier** (`r#`) or **trailing underscore** for names that are reserved words.\\n\\n\\n**Additional Tips:**\\n\\n\\n\\n- Favor clarity over brevity: Choose names that clearly convey the purpose of the item.\\n- Avoid abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely understood (e.g., `HTTP`, `XML`).\\n- Maintain consistency throughout the codebase for a uniform style.\\n\\n\\n### Purpose and Clarity\\n\\n\\n\\n- Clearly explain the purpose and functionality of code sections using comments.\\n\\n- Avoid redundant comments that simply restate the code itself.\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Use comments to clarify non-obvious logic, complex algorithms, or design choices.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-0-1)// This function calculates the average weight (in kilograms) of a herd of goats.\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-0-2)// It takes a vector of goat weights as input and returns the average weight as a float.\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-0-3)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-0-4)fn average_goat_weight(weights: &[f32]) ->

[](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-0-23)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Documentation for Public Items\\n\\n\\n\\n- Use doc comments for public items (functions, structs, enums) to provide a detailed description, usage examples, and relevant information for future developers using the code.\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Doc comments utilize a specific syntax starting with `///`.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n

(handle other variants)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-5-6)    }\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-5-7)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Iterators and Functional Programming\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Leverage Rust's powerful iterators and functional programming features for concise and expressive code, especially when dealing with collections like lists or vectors.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-1)fn suggest_favorite_foods(goat: &CheerfulChewer) -> Vec<FoodType> {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-2)    let all_foods = [FoodType::HaystackDelight, FoodType::OatmealSurprise, FoodType::CloverCrunch];\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-3)    all_foods.iter()\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-4)        .filter(|food| *food == goat.find_favorite_food().unwrap()) // Filter based on favorite food\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-5)        .cloned() // Clone the matched food type\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-6)        .collect() // Collect results into a vector\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-6-7)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Error Handling with `Result`\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Employ the `Result` type (`std::error::Result`) for robust error handling. It represents an operation that can either succeed with a value or fail with an error.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-1)fn find_favorite_food(goat_name: &str) -> Result<FoodType, String> {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-2)    // ... (logic to find the goat's favorite food)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-3)    if goat_name == \\\"Buttercup\\\" {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-4)        Ok(FoodType::OatmealSurprise)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-5)    } else {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-6)        Err(format!(\\\"Favorite food for {} unknown!\\\", goat_name))\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-7)    }\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-7-8)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Propagating and Handling Errors\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Propagate errors up the call stack when an error occurs within a function. This allows for handling the error at an appropriate level in your program.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-1)fn feed_goat(goat_name: &str, food: FoodType) -> Result<(), String> {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-2)    let favorite_food = find_favorite_food(goat_name)?; // Propagate error from find_favorite_food\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-3)    if favorite_food != food {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-4)        Err(format!(\\\"{} the goat only eats {}\\\", goat_name, favorite_food))\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-5)    } else {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-6)        Ok(())\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-7)    }\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-8-8)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Option Type\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Utilize the `Option` type to represent the possibility of a value being absent. This is particularly useful for handling potential errors or missing data gracefully.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-9-1)fn get_favorite_food(goat_name: &str) -> Option<FoodType> {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-9-2)    // ... (logic to find the goat's favorite food)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-9-3)    Some(FoodType::OatmealSurprise)  // Return Some(value) if found\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-9-4)    // or None if not found\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-9-5)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Iterators and Functional Programming Concepts\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Leverage Rust's powerful iterators and functional programming techniques like `map`, `filter`, and `fold` to manipulate collections and data structures concisely.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-1)let all_foods = [FoodType::HaystackDelight, FoodType::OatmealSurprise, FoodType::CloverCrunch];\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-2)let favorite_food = FoodType::OatmealSurprise;\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-3)let favorite_food_index = all_foods.iter().position(|food| *food == favorite_food);\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-4)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-5)match favorite_food_index {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-6)    Some(index) => println!(\\\"Favorite food found at index {}\\\", index),\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-7)    None => println!(\\\"Favorite food not found in the list\\\"),\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-10-8)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Generics\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Employ generics to write code that works with various data types, promoting code reusability and flexibility in your goat management program.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-11-1)fn feed_goat<T: Food>(goat: &mut CheerfulChewer, food: T) {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-11-2)    // ... (logic to feed the goat, potentially adjusting happiness based on food type T)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-11-3)}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Smart Pointers\\n\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n  Understand and utilize smart pointers like `Rc` (reference counting) or `Arc` (atomic reference counting) for managing memory ownership scenarios where multiple references to the same data are needed. Consider these for complex data structures within your goat herd.\\n\\n  Example\\n\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-1)use std::rc::Rc;\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-2)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-3)struct Herd {\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-4)    goats: Vec<Rc<CheerfulChewer>>, // Shared ownership of goat data\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-5)}\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-6)\\n    [](https://styles.goatbytes.io/lang/rust/#__codelineno-12-7)// ...

Rustdoc, the official documentation system, is no exception to this; it's simple to use, creates beautiful pages, and makes documentation a joy.\\n\\nWe take documentation seriously. Documentation is for many the first entry point into the code, and good documentation is a primary driver of code adoption (along with functionality). This left us wondering: what *are* the best practices for making quality Rust documentation via Rustdoc? Through the course of our research, we found a couple of key resources that the community has provided:\\n\\n- [The rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html): A great place to start if you're looking to learn how to write documentation in your crates.\\n\\n- [RFC 505: API Comment Conventions](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0505-api-comment-conventions.html) and [RFC 1574: More API Documentation Conventions](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.html): Explanations on how the [core Rust team](https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html) documents the standard library and language interfaces.\\n\\nHowever, while these are useful resources, we felt that a more approachable guide to crate documentation would be helpful to those starting out with their own crates. Through the course of this article, we'll find that Rust's crate+module structure naturally facilitates great documentation creation; we simply play to Rust's strengths.\\n\\nNote: this guide is about achieving **good documentation quality**. It does not lay out any technical or formatting guidelines. For instance, we internally wrap our documentation at 120 characters a line... but a 120-character line limit won't do much to improve bad docs.\\n\\nWe assume a bit of knowledge with rustdocs below. If you are unfamiliar with the program, we encourage you to read the rustdoc book linked above as a primer.\\n\\n## Goals of Documentation\\n\\nHere at [Tangram Vision](https://www.tangramvision.com/), we structure our documentation around two ideas:\\n\\n- *What*: Explaining what was built\\n\\n- *How*: Explaining how to use it\\n\\nAnything beyond this is generally not helpful, for one singular reason: our documentation assumes that our users know Rust. We believe this assumption is critical to creating good documentation around the What and How. The docs should rarely discuss *why* a decision was made, unless that decision goes against intuition; instead, the docs only explain how to capitalize on that decision in one's own code.\\n\\nThis guideline of User Knowledge naturally leads us to another rule: *Keep It Short.* The aim is to be succinct by telling the user the What and the How in as little time as possible. This often means using simple, active language and avoiding technical jargon. If a longer discussion is needed, make sure to put the What and the How first, and the discussion after.\\n\\nBoth the What and the How can be seen at all levels of documentation in Rust. We'll see how best to organize that in a large repository below while maintaining consistent style and language.\\n\\n## Documentation Across a Crate\\n\\nThere's a natural top-down pattern to follow for Rust documentation. The top level `lib.rs` or `main.rs` is the first things users see, so it's the perfect spot to introduce the big What ideas. As the documentation gets more into the weeds, from modules to types to functions, documentation shifts more to the How. We'll see this play out as we discuss the different levels below.\\n\\nWe have added relevant links to our own documentation in the [realsense-rust](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss/realsense-rust) crate maintained by Tangram Vision OSS. Check these out for added context.\\n\\n### Crate\\n\\nCrate-level example [here](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision/oss/realsense-rust/-/blob/main/src/lib.rs).\\n\\nThe crate documentation in `lib.rs` or `main.rs` should describe the purpose of the crate (the big What) alongside instructions and examples for getting started (the big How). This is a place for big ideas, since the details will come later in the lower levels. Any counter-intuitive design decisions or common gotchas should also be documented here, but remember: the What and the How always come first, and discussion follows.\\n\\nNotice how the first sections are\\n\\n1. Summary\\n\\n2. Features\\n\\n3. Usage\\n\\n...all explaining the big What and How. The documentation goes into more detail afterwards, with headings like \\\"Architecture & Guiding Principles\\\", \\\"Prefer Rust-native types to types used through the FFI\\\", etc. However, these sections are there only to explain the *non-intuitive* design decisions that go behind creating an FFI interface like this one. For those that don't care, the What and How are presented first, front and center.\\n\\n### Modules\\n\\nModule-level example [here](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision/oss/realsense-rust/-/blob/main/src/pipeline.rs).\\n\\nModules should contain more direct documentation than the crate itself. The focus again should be on describing the types found in that module and how they interact with the rest of the crate. From this alone, users should understand the Why, i.e. why they would reach for a module from your crate.\\n\\nThis can get a bit trickier with sub-modules. Avoid deeply nested sub-modules, since they complicate the structure of a crate. Modules with sub-modules more than two layers deep can probably be flattened out. Exceptions exist, but if this layering is needed, it makes sense to add a **Why** discussion to explain what made this necessary.\\n\\n### Types\\n\\nType-level example [here](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision/oss/realsense-rust/-/blob/9d490f386e608f3dc24c89ea2cda8fe99dea1e87/src/frame/image.rs#L52).\\n\\nTypes are our primary way of defining abstraction and ontological separations in our code. Documentation here should focus on:\\n\\n- Construction of the type (when and how, if users are allowed to construct their own).\\n\\n- Destruction / dropping the type → what happens when you drop a value of a given type? If you don't implement the `Drop` trait, then this is probably OK to ignore.\\n\\n- Performance characteristics of the type, if it is a data structure.\\n\\nAs one can see, the documentation naturally de-emphasizes the What and builds on the How as we go down. Again, counter-intuitive or non-obvious cases might have a Why, but the What and the How together should suffice.\\n\\n### Functions\\n\\nFunction-level example [here](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision/oss/realsense-rust/-/blob/9d490f386e608f3dc24c89ea2cda8fe99dea1e87/src/frame/image.rs#L181).\\n\\nThe last thing to document is functions and associated functions (functions in `impl` blocks). This could include constructors, mutable functions, or data returned by accessors on a type or types. Semantic and code examples are especially welcome here because they describe the How in practical terms.\\n\\n## Common Sections Across a Crate\\n\\nCrate and module level documentation can be broken down into multiple sections with heading levels 1 (`#` in markdown), 2 (`##` ), and 3 (`###` ). As you move towards documenting types and functions, aim to be as flat as possible; only use heading level 1 if a section is needed.\\n\\nThese headings are ordered below (in our humble opinion) according to their usefulness for the user in conveying the What and the How for a Rust crate. It's important to note that not all headings need to be present at all times. If it doesn't make sense, don't add it, since it just increases the cognitive burden on the user.\\n\\n### `# Examples`\\n\\nExamples are, by far, the easiest and most concise way to convey How. They are welcome at all levels: module, type, function, or crate. Write examples for both common use cases and corner cases, like with `Error` or `None` results.\\n\\nExamples in `rustdoc` documentation will compile and run as doc-tests. This is an **important point**: all code in the documentation will actually compile and run! This means they automatically provide users with starting point for understanding. This is one of Rustdoc's greatest strengths, and it should be utilized whenever possible.\\n\\na frame of reference for the HowMake these examples functional code whenever possible. If this is *not* possible, e.g. with an example explaining improper usage, tha frame of reference for the Howen use the heading `text` or `ignore` next to the code block:\\n\\nNotice the heading is \\\"Examples\\\", plural. Be consistent with the plurality here. Even if there is only one example, the consistency helps with searching.\\n\\n### `# Errors`\\n\\nAt their best, Errors help a user understand why a certain action is prevented by the crate and how to respond to it. It's a rare instance where explaining the *Why* is not just encouraged, but necessary for proper use.\\n\\nAt a function level, this section is only needed if that function returns a `Result` type. In this case, it describes the type returned and when the error should be expected, e.g. an invalid internal state, Foreign Function Interface (FFI) interactions, bad arguments, etc.\\n\\nMake errors actionable by either passing them to a higher level function or allowing a reaction from the caller. It is easier for users to understand how they got there in the first place by writing error types with reaction in mind. Moreover, if a caller can't act on an error, then there's not a strong reason to present it in the first place.\\n\\n### `# Safety`\\n\\nFirst and foremost: Try to minimize unsafe interfaces where possible. Rust is a language built on memory safety, and violating this tenet should only be done with conscious intention. The Safety section should convey that intention.\\n\\nWhen documenting Safety, be explicit about what is \\\"unsafe\\\" about the interface and explain best practices for its use with safe code. If possible, try to specify undefined behavior if an unsafe interface will leave your program in an undefined state.\\n\\n### `# Panics`\\n\\nUse this section if a function can `panic!` . Complete coverage would aim to document any and all calls to `.unwrap()` , `debug_assert!` , etc.\\n\\nComplete coverage is a good goal to aim for, but realize that a `panic!` call isn't always necessary. Many cases can be guarded against with small code changes. Returning `Result` types can avoid this entirely in exchange for better error handling. Low-level FFI calls can unwrap and `panic!` if passed a null pointer; yet this can be prevented if you start with `NonNull<t>` as the input, making an `unwrap()` call superfluous.\\n\\nIn any case, you should aim to have all error cases implemented whenever possible. If there is a case that can cause a `panic!` , list it in the docs.\\n\\n### `# Lifetimes`\\n\\nInclude a Lifetimes section if a type or function has special lifetime considerations that need to be taken into consideration by the user. Most of the time, a lifetime itself doesn't need describing; again, always assume users know Rust. Rather, this section should explain why the lifetime has been modeled in a certain way.\\n\\nRule of thumb: If you only have one lifetime (explicit or implicit), it probably doesn't need documentation.\\n\\n    pub struct SomeType<'a> {\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n        pointer: std::ptr::NonNull<std::os::raw::c_void>,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n        _phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<&'a ()=\\\"\\\">,\\n    }\\n\\nThe above example shows one instance in where a (single) strange lifetime is applied to enforce Rust's lifetime rules on a type. The lifetime *seems* superfluous, but may exist because there is some implicit assumption in C that is being made more explicit here.\\n\\n### `# Arguments`\\n\\nAvoid listing arguments explicitly. Instead, names and types themselves should adequately describe arguments and their relationships.\\n\\nThat being said, an `# Arguments` section can make sense if there is a non-obvious assumption about the arguments or their types that needs to be made explicit, like if passing in certain values for a type invokes *undefined behaviour.* In such a case, an `# Arguments` or `# Generic Arguments` section is useful to clarify that care is needed when passing in data.\\n\\nFor generic arguments that may require trait bounds, \\\"document\\\" these by adding `where` clauses to your function or type. This is much more descriptive and useful, and has the added benefit of your compiler doing some of the work to validate these bounds for you.\\n\\nTake a look at [the standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve) for examples of good argument names and types.\\n\\n## A Few Last Details\\n\\nThe below points deserve to be noted, but don't necessarily fit into any specific framework.\\n\\n### Document Traits, Not Trait Implementations\\n\\nTraits are trickier than regular types and associated functions. Since a trait can be applied to multiple types (even those outside of its crate), don't document implementations of a trait. Instead, document the trait itself.\\n\\nGood\\n\\n    pub trait NumberAdder {\\n  \\n        fn add_integer(&mut self, number: i32);\\n\\n  \\n        fn add_float(&mut self, number: f32);\\n    }\\n\\nBad\\n\\n    impl NumberAdder for Foo {\\n  \\n        fn add_integer(&mut self, number: i32) {\\n  \\n        }\\n\\n  \\n        fn add_float(&mut self, number: f32) {\\n  \\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nTraits are used primarily in generic code, so users will look at the trait itself to understand the interfaces. Any two types implementing the same trait should share common functionality; if two implementations of a trait require vastly differing documentation, the trait itself may not be modeled correctly.\\n\\n### References Should Always Be Links\\n\\nWhenever a reference is made, whether it be to another part of the documentation, a website, a paper, or another crate: add a link to it. This applies even when referencing a common type found in the standard library (e.g. `String` , `Vec` , etc.).\\n\\nLinking to other parts of the documentation avoids repeating information. It is also an easy way to point to higher level architecture decisions that might affect the lower level documentation.\\n\\n`rustdoc` handles documentation links natively. Example:\\n\\n## Examples and Resources\\n\\n### Open-Source Documentation Examples\\n\\nWe've worked hard at [Tangram Vision](https://www.tangramvision.com/) to follow our own guidelines and create world-class Rust documentation. You can read the fruits of our labor by visiting any of the repositories at our [Open-Source software group](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss). The [RealSense Rust](https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss/realsense-rust) package that we maintain is some of our most complete documentation, and acts a good starting point.\\n\\n### Templates\\n\\nMost of these examples come in the form:\\n\\n### Types\\n\\n    #[derive(Debug)]\\n    pub enum SetOptionError {\\n  \\n        OptionNotSupported,\\n  \\n        OptionIsImmutable,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n        CouldNotSetOption(String),\\n    }\\n\\n### Functions\\n\\n    pub fn set_option(\\n        &self,\\n        option: SomeOption,\\n        value: f32,\\n    ) -> Result<(), SetOptionError> {\\n  \\n        unimplemented!();\\n    }\\n\\n## Bad Documentation\\n\\n    pub fn get_option(&self, option: Rs2Option) -> Option<f32>;\\n\\nWhy is this bad?\\n\\n1. The Arguments section is superfluous, since the names and types of the arguments make their use self-evident. See the Arguments section above.\\n\\n2. The `# Returns` section isn't needed at all. First off, \\\"Returns\\\" should not be a header category; this information can be more concisely expressed in the function summary. Secondly, the return type that is there (`Option<f32>` ) makes the possible return values clear already to the user.\\n\\nA more correct way to write this example would be:\\n\\n    pub fn get_option(&self, option: Rs2Option) -> Option<f32>;\\n\\n\u{200d}\\n\\n========================\\n**Table of Contents**\\n\\n- [Idiomatic Coding Guidelines](#idiomatic-coding-guidelines)\\n  - [API Design Guidelines](#api-design-guidelines)\\n  - [Code Styling Guidelines](#code-styling-guidelines)\\n  - [Code Design Patterns](#code-design-patterns)\\n  - [Comments Guidelines](#comments-guidelines)\\n  - [Documentation Guidelines](#documentation-guidelines)\\n  - [Error Handling](#error-handling)\\n  - [Naming Convention Recommendation](#naming-convention-recommendation)\\n  - [Testing Guidelines](#testing-guidelines)\\n- [Development and Tool Resources](#development-and-tool-resources)\\n  - [Resources by Application Type](#resources-by-application-type)\\n    - [Asynchronous Applications](#asynchronous-applications)\\n    - [Command Line Applications](#command-line-applications)\\n    - [Embedded Software](#embedded-software)\\n    - [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#graphical-user-interface-gui)\\n    - [Graphics and Games](#graphics-and-games)\\n    - [Machine Learning and Data](#machine-learning-and-data)\\n    - [Web Applications](#web-applications)\\n  - [Tools and Libraries Learning](#tools-and-libraries-learning)\\n    - [Build Systems, Package Management, and Other Tools](#build-systems-package-management-and-other-tools)\\n    - [Development Environment](#development-environment)\\n    - [Rust Compiler](#rust-compiler)\\n- [Extra](#extra)\\n\\nWhat coding style should I adopt for my Rust code to ensure consistency with my favorite Rust libraries?\\nWhere can I learn to develop a specific application using Rust and which libraries should I utilize?\\nHow can I make the most of Rust development tools?\\n\\nIs there a specific place I can visit to find resources that will aid me in answering these questions?\\n\\nThis post serves as our index to resources that help developers like you master Rust and write excellent Rust code.\\nIf you haven’t started learning Rust yet, begin by:\\n\\n- Reading the [Rust programming language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).\\n- Keeping the [Rust language cheat sheet](https://cheats.rs/) handy for quick reference.\\n\\n\\nWe’ll update the content as needed to include new relevant resources.\\n\\n#### Newsletter\\n\\nSubscribe to our newsletter and stay updated.\\n\\n#### Thank you!\\n\\nThanks for signing up!

In this way, a person\\ncontributing from time to time to the kernel does not need to learn and\\nremember one more style guide. More importantly, reviewers and maintainers\\ndo not need to spend time pointing out style issues anymore, and thus\\nless patch roundtrips may be needed to land a change.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nConventions on comments and documentation are not checked by`rustfmt`. Thus those are still needed to be taken care of.\\n\\nThe default settings of `rustfmt` are used. This means the idiomatic Rust\\nstyle is followed. For instance, 4 spaces are used for indentation rather\\nthan tabs.\\n\\nIt is convenient to instruct editors/IDEs to format while typing,\\nwhen saving or at commit time. However, if for some reason reformatting\\nthe entire kernel Rust sources is needed at some point, the following can be\\nrun:\\n\\n    make LLVM=1 rustfmt\\n\\nIt is also possible to check if everything is formatted (printing a diff\\notherwise), for instance for a CI, with:\\n\\n    make LLVM=1 rustfmtcheck\\n\\nLike `clang-format` for the rest of the kernel, `rustfmt` works on\\nindividual files, and does not require a kernel configuration. Sometimes it may\\neven work with broken code.\\n\\n### Imports[¶](#imports \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\n`rustfmt`, by default, formats imports in a way that is prone to conflicts\\nwhile merging and rebasing, since in some cases it condenses several items into\\nthe same line. For instance:\\n\\n    // Do not use this style.\\n    use crate::{\\n        example1,\\n        example2::{example3, example4, example5},\\n        example6, example7,\\n        example8::example9,\\n    };\\n\\nInstead, the kernel uses a vertical layout that looks like this:\\n\\n    use crate::{\\n        example1,\\n        example2::{\\n            example3,\\n            example4,\\n            example5, //\\n        },\\n        example6,\\n        example7,\\n        example8::example9, //\\n    };\\n\\nThat is, each item goes into its own line, and braces are used as soon as there\\nis more than one item in a list.\\n\\nThe trailing empty comment allows to preserve this formatting. Not only that,`rustfmt` will actually reformat imports vertically when the empty comment is\\nadded. That is, it is possible to easily reformat the original example into the\\nexpected style by running `rustfmt` on an input like:\\n\\n    // Do not use this style.\\n    use crate::{\\n        example1,\\n        example2::{example3, example4, example5, //\\n        },\\n        example6, example7,\\n        example8::example9, //\\n    };\\n\\nThe trailing empty comment works for nested imports, as shown above, as well as\\nfor single item imports -- this can be useful to minimize diffs within patch\\nseries:\\n\\n    use crate::{\\n        example1, //\\n    };\\n\\nThe trailing empty comment works in any of the lines within the braces, but it\\nis preferred to keep it in the last item, since it is reminiscent of the\\ntrailing comma in other formatters. Sometimes it may be simpler to avoid moving\\nthe comment several times within a patch series due to changes in the list.\\n\\nThere may be cases where exceptions may need to be made, i.e. none of this is\\na hard rule. There is also code that is not migrated to this style yet, but\\nplease do not introduce code in other styles.\\n\\nEventually, the goal is to get `rustfmt` to support this formatting style (or\\na similar one) automatically in a stable release without requiring the trailing\\nempty comment. Thus, at some point, the goal is to remove those comments.\\n\\n## Code documentation[¶](#code-documentation \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nRust kernel code is not documented like C kernel code (i.e. via kernel-doc).\\nInstead, the usual system for documenting Rust code is used: the `rustdoc` tool, which uses Markdown (a lightweight markup language).\\n\\nTo learn Markdown, there are many guides available out there. For instance,\\nthe one at:\\n\\nThis is how a well-documented Rust function may look like:\\n\\n    /// Returns the contained [`Some`] value, consuming the `self` value,\\n    /// without checking that the value is not [`None`].\\n    ///\\n    /// # Safety\\n    ///\\n    /// Calling this method on [`None`] is *[undefined behavior]*.\\n    ///\\n    /// [undefined behavior]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\\n    ///\\n    /// # Examples\\n    ///\\n    /// ```\\n    /// let x = Some(\\\"air\\\");\\n    /// assert_eq!(unsafe { x.unwrap_unchecked() }, \\\"air\\\");\\n    /// ```\\n    pub unsafe fn unwrap_unchecked(self) -> T {\\n        match self {\\n            Some(val) => val,\\n\\n            // SAFETY: The safety contract must be upheld by the caller.\\n            None => unsafe { hint::unreachable_unchecked() },\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nThis example showcases a few `rustdoc` features and some conventions followed\\nin the kernel:\\n\\n- The first paragraph must be a single sentence briefly describing what\\nthe documented item does. Further explanations must go in extra paragraphs.\\n\\n- Unsafe functions must document their safety preconditions under\\na `# Safety` section.\\n\\n- While not shown here, if a function may panic, the conditions under which\\nthat happens must be described under a `# Panics` section.\\n\\n  Please note that panicking should be very rare and used only with a good\\nreason. In almost all cases, a fallible approach should be used, typically\\nreturning a `Result`.\\n\\n- If providing examples of usage would help readers, they must be written in\\na section called `# Examples`.\\n\\n- Rust items (functions, types, constants...) must be linked appropriately\\n(`rustdoc` will create a link automatically).\\n\\n- Any `unsafe` block must be preceded by a `// SAFETY:` comment\\ndescribing why the code inside is sound.\\n\\n  While sometimes the reason might look trivial and therefore unneeded,\\nwriting these comments is not just a good way of documenting what has been\\ntaken into account, but most importantly, it provides a way to know that\\nthere are no *extra* implicit constraints.\\n\\nTo learn more about how to write documentation for Rust and extra features,\\nplease take a look at the `rustdoc` book at:\\n\\nIn addition, the kernel supports creating links relative to the source tree by\\nprefixing the link destination with `srctree/`. For instance:\\n\\n    //! C header: [`include/linux/printk.h`](srctree/include/linux/printk.h)\\n\\nor:\\n\\n    /// [`struct mutex`]: srctree/include/linux/mutex.h\\n\\n## C FFI types[¶](#c-ffi-types \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nRust kernel code refers to C types, such as `int`, using type aliases such as `c_int`, which are readily available from the `kernel` prelude. Please do\\nnot use the aliases from `core::ffi` -- they may not map to the correct types.\\n\\nThese aliases should generally be referred directly by their identifier, i.e.\\nas a single segment path. For instance:\\n\\n    fn f(p: *const c_char) -> c_int {\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\n## Naming[¶](#naming \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nRust kernel code follows the usual Rust naming conventions:\\n\\nWhen existing C concepts (e.g. macros, functions, objects...) are wrapped into\\na Rust abstraction, a name as close as reasonably possible to the C side should\\nbe used in order to avoid confusion and to improve readability when switching\\nback and forth between the C and Rust sides. For instance, macros such as`pr_info` from C are named the same in the Rust side.\\n\\nHaving said that, casing should be adjusted to follow the Rust naming\\nconventions, and namespacing introduced by modules and types should not be\\nrepeated in the item names. For instance, when wrapping constants like:\\n\\n    #define GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN  0\\n    #define GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_OUT 1\\n\\nThe equivalent in Rust may look like (ignoring documentation):\\n\\n    pub mod gpio {\\n        pub enum LineDirection {\\n            In = bindings::GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN as _,\\n            Out = bindings::GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_OUT as _,\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nThat is, the equivalent of `GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN` would be referred to as `gpio::LineDirection::In`. In particular, it should not be named `gpio::gpio_line_direction::GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN`.\\n\\n## Lints[¶](#lints \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nIn Rust, it is possible to `allow` particular warnings (diagnostics, lints)\\nlocally, making the compiler ignore instances of a given warning within a given\\nfunction, module, block, etc.\\n\\nIt is similar to `#pragma GCC diagnostic push` + `ignored` + `pop` in C [[1]](#id2):\\n\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic push\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \\\"-Wunused-function\\\"\\n    static void f(void) {}\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic pop\\n\\nBut way less verbose:\\n\\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\\n    fn f() {}\\n\\nBy that virtue, it makes it possible to comfortably enable more diagnostics by\\ndefault (i.e. outside `W=` levels). In particular, those that may have some\\nfalse positives but that are otherwise quite useful to keep enabled to catch\\npotential mistakes.\\n\\nOn top of that, Rust provides the `expect` attribute which takes this further.\\nIt makes the compiler warn if the warning was not produced. For instance, the\\nfollowing will ensure that, when `f()` is called somewhere, we will have to\\nremove the attribute:\\n\\n    #[expect(dead_code)]\\n    fn f() {}\\n\\nIf we do not, we get a warning from the compiler:\\n\\n    warning: this lint expectation is unfulfilled\\n     --> x.rs:3:10\\n      |\\n    3 | #[expect(dead_code)]\\n      |          ^^^^^^^^^\\n      |\\n      = note: `#[warn(unfulfilled_lint_expectations)]` on by default\\n\\nThis means that `expect`s do not get forgotten when they are not needed, which\\nmay happen in several situations, e.g.:\\n\\n- Temporary attributes added while developing.\\n\\n- Improvements in lints in the compiler, Clippy or custom tools which may\\nremove a false positive.\\n\\n- When the lint is not needed anymore because it was expected that it would be\\nremoved at some point, such as the `dead_code` example above.\\n\\nIt also increases the visibility of the remaining `allow`s and reduces the\\nchance of misapplying one.\\n\\nThus prefer `expect` over `allow` unless:\\n\\n- Conditional compilation triggers the warning in some cases but not others.\\n\\n  If there are only a few cases where the warning triggers (or does not\\ntrigger) compared to the total number of cases, then one may consider using\\na conditional `expect` (i.e. `cfg_attr(..., expect(...))`). Otherwise,\\nit is likely simpler to just use `allow`.\\n\\n- Inside macros, when the different invocations may create expanded code that\\ntriggers the warning in some cases but not in others.\\n\\n- When code may trigger a warning for some architectures but not others, such\\nas an `as` cast to a C FFI type.\\n\\nAs a more developed example, consider for instance this program:\\n\\n    fn g() {}\\n\\n    fn main() {\\n        #[cfg(CONFIG_X)]\\n        g();\\n    }\\n\\nHere, function `g()` is dead code if `CONFIG_X` is not set. Can we use `expect` here?\\n\\n    #[expect(dead_code)]\\n    fn g() {}\\n\\n    fn main() {\\n        #[cfg(CONFIG_X)]\\n        g();\\n    }\\n\\nThis would emit a lint if `CONFIG_X` is set, since it is not dead code in that\\nconfiguration. Therefore, in cases like this, we cannot use `expect` as-is.\\n\\nA simple possibility is using `allow`:\\n\\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\\n    fn g() {}\\n\\n    fn main() {\\n        #[cfg(CONFIG_X)]\\n        g();\\n    }\\n\\nAn alternative would be using a conditional `expect`:\\n\\n    #[cfg_attr(not(CONFIG_X), expect(dead_code))]\\n    fn g() {}\\n\\n    fn main() {\\n        #[cfg(CONFIG_X)]\\n        g();\\n    }\\n\\nThis would ensure that, if someone introduces another call to `g()` somewhere\\n(e.g. unconditionally), then it would be spotted that it is not dead code\\nanymore. However, the `cfg_attr` is more complex than a simple `allow`.\\n\\nTherefore, it is likely that it is not worth using conditional `expect`s when\\nmore than one or two configurations are involved or when the lint may be\\ntriggered due to non-local changes (such as `dead_code`).\\n\\nFor more information about diagnostics in Rust, please see:\\n\\n## Error handling[¶](#error-handling \\\"Permalink to this heading\\\")\\n\\nFor some background and guidelines about Rust for Linux specific error handling,\\nplease see:\\n\\n========================\\n\""

out how to get the most out of these powerful new [language models](/resources/articles/large-language-models). The practice was quickly dubbed ”prompt engineering,” and with it came breathless predictions that “prompt engineer” would become the hottest job title of the decade. LinkedIn filled up with self-proclaimed experts, and rumors of six-figure salaries circulated widely. Fast forward to now, and that initial hype cycle has [cooled considerably](https://fortune.com/2025/05/07/prompt-engineering-200k-six-figure-role-now-obsolete-thanks-to-ai/).\\n\\nBut the underlying skill—crafting inputs that produce genuinely useful outputs—has only grown more important as AI tools have embedded themselves into real workflows. Whether you’re generating a quarterly analysis with [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5), producing product photos with Google’s [Nano Banana](/resources/articles/nano-banana) Pro, or debugging a complex function with [OpenAI’s Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/), the difference between a vague instruction and a well-crafted prompt may mean the difference between getting generic outputs and exactly what you need. Read on for prompt engineering best practices—from using few-shot examples to guide output format to breaking complex tasks into smaller steps—that will help you get useful results on the first try instead of the fifth.\\n\\n**Key takeaways**:\\n\\n- Prompt engineering is the process of writing and structuring inputs so large language models produce clearer, more accurate, and more useful responses for a given task.\\n\\n- Key techniques include zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, role or persona prompting, prompt chaining, meta-prompting, and reflection prompting to guide reasoning and output quality.\\n\\n- Prompt engineering best practices focus on being specific, providing clear context, examples, and data, defining the desired output, and giving instructions on what to do rather than what to avoid.\\n\\n- Strong results from LLMs come from iterating on prompts, testing variations, understanding model limitations, and refining inputs based on the quality and consistency of responses.\\n\\n## [What is prompt engineering?](#what-is-prompt-engineering)\\n\\nPrompt engineering is the process of carefully designing the inputs you give to large language models to get desired outputs. It includes word choice, how you order instructions, what context you provide, and whether you include examples. At a more advanced level, it means knowing when to use techniques like few-shot prompting—providing input-output pairs so the model learns your desired format—or chain-of-thought prompting, where you ask the model to reason step-by-step before delivering a final answer. And despite the name, prompt engineering isn’t just for engineers: it’s for anyone using [AI assistant tools](/resources/articles/claude-ai-alternative-assistants) like Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT who wants better results, whether you’re writing code or drafting social posts.\\n\\nWatch how to use prompting in Cursor with [DigitalOcean’s MCP server](https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/mcp-digitalocean) to build, deploy, update, and manage an [App Platform](/products/app-platform) React app using natural language instead of juggling terminals, dashboards, and scripts. Follow along as a simple React app goes from setup to live deployment and iteration entirely from within your editor.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpJjydsqvBA](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpJjydsqvBA)\\n\\n## [Why is prompt engineering important?](#why-is-prompt-engineering-important)\\n\\nAs models like Llama 4, [Grok 3](/resources/articles/grok-vs-chatgpt), and [DeepSeek-R1](/community/tutorials/deepseek-r1-large-language-model-capabilities) grow more capable, the quality of your input increasingly determines the quality of your output. In other words, how you phrase a request shapes what you get back. A poorly structured prompt may require multiple back-and-forth exchanges to clarify intent, whereas a thoughtfully engineered prompt yields usable results on the first (or second) attempt.\\n\\n- **It reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy**: Explicitly giving the model permission to say “I don’t know” when it lacks sufficient information makes it less likely to [hallucinate](/resources/articles/ai-hallucination) and fabricate answers. Providing relevant context and source material gives the model a factual foundation to work from, rather than relying solely on training data.\\n\\n- **It unlocks better performance for code generation**: When using tools like OpenAI’s [Codex CLI](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex/) or asking Claude to debug a script, prompts that include leading words like “import” or “SELECT” nudge the model toward the correct output pattern. Specifying the programming language, expected inputs and outputs, and edge cases to handle produces code that’s closer to production-ready.\\n\\n- **It makes complex reasoning more transparent and reliable**: Chain-of-thought prompting asks the model to reason step-by-step before delivering a final answer, which is especially valuable for multi-step math problems or analytical tasks. This technique surfaces the model’s logic so you spot errors mid-process rather than discovering them in the final output.\\n\\n- **It gives you control over output format and structure**: Few-shot prompting with input-output examples teaches the model the exact style, tone, or schema you’re looking for, whether that’s a [JSON](/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-json) object, a bulleted summary, or a formal report.\\n\\n- **It improves results for image generation and multimodal tasks**: When prompting image models like [DALL-E 3](/resources/articles/dall-e-alternatives) or [Midjourney](/resources/articles/midjourney-alternatives), specificity around lighting, composition, and style dramatically affects output quality. The same principle applies to [vision-language models](/community/tutorials/visualizing-vision-language-models-multimodal-reasoning): asking Claude to analyze a chart step-by-step in structured tags yields more accurate data extraction than a generic “describe this image” request.\\n\\n## [Types of prompting engineering techniques](#types-of-prompting-engineering-techniques)\\n\\nDifferent tasks call for different approaches. A simple question might need nothing more than a clear instruction, while a multi-step analysis might require examples, [structured reasoning](/community/tutorials/understanding-reasoning-in-llms), or breaking the work into stages. The techniques below range from basic to advanced, and they can (and should) be combined depending on what you’re trying to accomplish.\\n\\n| Technique | What it does | Best for | Example use case |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Zero-shot | Direct instruction with no examples | Simple, well-defined tasks | “Translate this sentence to French” |\\n| Few-shot | Provides input-output examples before the request | Format-sensitive or style-specific outputs | Teaching the model your preferred summary format |\\n| Chain-of-thought | Asks the model to reason step-by-step | Math, logic, and multi-step analysis | Walking through a word problem before answering |\\n| Tree-of-thought | Explores multiple reasoning paths before selecting the best one | Complex problems requiring strategic planning | Solving puzzles or multi-step decisions with backtracking |\\n| Role or persona | Assigns the model an identity or expertise | Domain-specific tasks requiring a particular tone | “You are a senior Python developer reviewing this code” |\\n| Prompt chaining | Breaks complex tasks into sequential prompts | Multi-stage workflows with dependencies | Summarize → critique → revise |\\n| Meta-prompting | Uses an LLM to generate or improve prompts | Optimizing prompts at scale or for reusable templates | Having a model refine your summarization prompt |\\n| Reflection prompting | Asks the model to critique and refine its own output | Catching errors and improving accuracy | “Review your answer for mistakes and correct them” |\\n\\n### [Zero-shot prompting](#zero-shot-prompting)\\n\\nZero-shot prompting is the most straightforward approach: you give the model a direct instruction without any examples. This works well when the task is clear, and the expected output format is obvious, like asking “What’s the capital of Japan?” or “Summarize this paragraph in two sentences.” The model relies entirely on its training to interpret what you want. Zero-shot is fast and requires minimal setup, but it falls short when you need a specific structure, tone, or style that isn’t implicit in the instruction itself.\\n\\n### [Few-shot prompting](#few-shot-prompting)\\n\\nFew-shot prompting provides one or more input-output examples before your actual request, helping the model learn the pattern you’re looking for. For instance, if you want summaries in a specific format, you might show two examples of articles paired with your preferred summary style, then ask the model to summarize a third article the same way. This technique is especially useful when the desired output involves subtle formatting, tone, or conventions that are hard to describe in words alone, or when your data involves multiple different categorizations or classifications that benefit from clarification. Start with one example (one-shot), then add more if the output still isn’t matching your expectations.\\n\\nMaster [few-shot prompting](/community/tutorials/_few-shot-prompting-techniques-examples-best-practices) by providing input-output examples that teach LLMs to recognize patterns without fine-tuning. Learn when to use zero-shot vs. few-shot approaches, plus implementation techniques with the OpenAI API and LangChain.\\n\\n### [Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](#chain-of-thought-cot-prompting)\\n\\nChain-of-thought prompting asks the model to show its reasoning before delivering a final answer. The simplest version is adding “Think step-by-step” to your prompt, which encourages the model to work through the problem rather than jumping straight to a conclusion. For example, instead of asking “What’s 15% of 340?” you might prompt: “Calculate 15% of 340. Show your work step-by-step, then give the final answer.”\\n\\nThis technique shines when it comes to math problems, logic puzzles, and analytical tasks where intermediate steps matter. It also makes errors easier to spot—if the model’s reasoning goes wrong at step two, you get to catch it before it compounds into a bad final answer. Some models, like [Claude’s extended thinking mode](https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking), automate this process, but manual CoT remains valuable when you need transparent, reviewable logic.\\n\\n### [Tree-of-thought (ToT) prompting](#tree-of-thought-tot-prompting)\\n\\nTree-of-thought prompting extends chain-of-thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously rather than following a single chain. Instead of committing to one line of reasoning, the model generates several possible approaches, evaluates each one, and backtracks if a path isn’t working—similar to how humans solve complex problems through trial and error.\\n\\nThis technique is especially useful for tasks that require strategic planning, like game-playing or multi-step decisions, where an early wrong choice may derail the entire solution. ToT is more resource-intensive than simpler methods and is typically overkill for straightforward tasks, but it outperforms other techniques on problems that benefit from deliberate exploration and self-evaluation. A [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601) conducted by researchers at Princeton and Google DeepMind found that tree-of-thought prompting achieved a 74% success rate on the Game of 24 benchmark—a math puzzle using four numbers to reach 24. This result was much higher than chain-of-thought (49%) and standard input-output prompting (33%)—but at a higher cost per case ($0.74 vs. $0.47 and $0.13).\\n\\n### [Role or persona prompting](#role-or-persona-prompting)\\n\\nRole prompting assigns the model a specific identity, expertise, or perspective to shape the scope of how it responds. A prompt like “You are an experienced immigration attorney” will produce a different answer than “You are a travel blogger” when asked about visa requirements—the attorney focuses on legal accuracy, while the blogger might emphasize practical tips. This technique is useful when you need domain-specific vocabulary, a particular communication style, or responses calibrated to a certain audience.\\n\\nThat said, modern models are sophisticated enough that heavy-handed role assignments (“You are a world-renowned expert who never makes mistakes”) may actually backfire by limiting helpfulness. A lighter touch often works better: instead of assigning a role, try being explicit about the perspective you want, like “Analyze this investment portfolio with a focus on risk tolerance and long-term growth.”\\n\\n### [Prompt chaining](#prompt-chaining)\\n\\nPrompt chaining breaks a complex task into smaller sequential steps, where the output of one prompt becomes the input for the next. Rather than asking a model to “research this topic, outline an article, write the draft, and edit it for tone” in a single prompt, you’d handle each stage separately: first generate research notes, then feed those into an outline prompt, then expand the outline into a draft, and finally run an editing pass. This approach trades speed for accuracy—each individual prompt is easier for the model to execute well, and you get to review or adjust the output at each stage before moving on.\\n\\nPrompt chaining is particularly effective for workflows that involve analysis followed by synthesis, like summarizing a document, grading the summary for completeness, then improving it based on that feedback. It’s typically implemented programmatically via API or AI workflow tools, but you can also do it manually in a chat interface by copying outputs between prompts. The manual approach gives you human-in-the-loop control over complex workflows, letting you apply your own judgment and make adjustments between steps.\\n\\n### [Meta-prompting](#meta-prompting)\\n\\nMeta-prompting uses an LLM to generate, refine, or improve prompts rather than writing them yourself from scratch. Instead of crafting every detail manually, you provide a high-level description of what you want and let the model propose an improved version—or you use a more capable model to optimize prompts for a less capable one.\\n\\nThis technique is useful when you need reusable prompt templates, want to systematically improve prompts across a category of tasks, or are building applications where prompt quality directly impacts results at scale. Tools like [ChatPRD](https://www.chatprd.ai/) are built around this idea—they take your high-level product concepts and turn them into structured prompts that AI can use to generate apps or features. Meta-prompting lets you work at the level of what you want rather than getting bogged down in the exact phrasing needed to make AI understand it.\\n\\n### [Reflection prompting](#reflection-prompting)\\n\\nReflection prompting asks the model to critique, evaluate, or refine its own output before delivering a final answer. After generating an initial response, you prompt the model to review its work—checking for errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement—and then produce a revised version based on that self-assessment.\\n\\nUse this approach for tasks where accuracy matters and a second pass catches mistakes that slipped through the first attempt. For example, after generating code, you might prompt: “Review the code above for bugs or edge cases, then provide a corrected version.” Reflection adds [latency](/resources/articles/network-latency) since it requires additional processing, but it often improves output quality on complex reasoning, writing, and problem-solving tasks.\\n\\n## [10 prompt engineering best practices](#10-prompt-engineering-best-practices)\\n\\nWhether you’re generating code, drafting marketing copy, analyzing data, or building automated workflows, the following practices apply across use cases and prompting techniques. Think of them as universal habits that make any prompt more effective—regardless of the specific model you’re using or what you’re trying to accomplish.\\n\\nChallenge yourself with a fun image prompt guessing game that reveals how specific wording guides generative results, sharpening your understanding of effective prompting. See how small changes in phrasing influence outputs and build intuition for prompt design with hands-on feedback.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kfzr6wR8LNs](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kfzr6wR8LNs)\\n\\n### [1. Be as specific as possible](#1-be-as-specific-as-possible)\\n\\nSpecificity is key to obtaining the most accurate and relevant information from an AI when writing prompts. A specific prompt minimizes ambiguity, allowing the AI to understand the request’s context and nuance, preventing it from providing overly broad or unrelated responses. To achieve this, include as many relevant details as possible without overloading the AI with superfluous information so context stays focused. This balance ensures that the AI has just enough guidance to produce the specific outcome you’re aiming for.\\n\\nWhen creating the best prompts for an AI, ask for the following specifics:\\n\\n- **Detailed context**: Provide the AI with enough background information to understand the scenario you’re inquiring about. This includes the subject matter, scope, and any relevant constraints.\\n\\n- **Desired format**: Clearly specify the format in which you want the information to be presented, whether it’s a list, a detailed report, bullet points, or a summary. Mention any structural preferences, such as headings, subheadings, or paragraph limits.\\n\\n- **Output length**: Detail how long you want the AI’s response, whether that’s “3 paragraphs” or “250 words.”\\n\\n- **Level of detail**: Indicate the level of detail required for the response, from high-level overviews to in-depth analysis, to ensure the model’s output matches your informational needs. For example, “Give me a five-sentence summary of this report” will produce a very different output than “Walk me through each section of this report and explain the key findings in detail.”\\n\\n- **Tone and style**: A prompt asking for “a professional summary for stakeholders” will produce something very different from “a casual explainer for a blog audience.” If you have a specific lens in mind—formal, conversational, persuasive, technical—say so upfront rather than editing after the fact.\\n\\n- **Examples and comparisons**: Asking the model to include analogies or concrete examples often makes the output more useful and easier to apply. A prompt like “Explain how neural networks learn and give me a real-world comparison” produces a more memorable response than one that stays purely abstract—like “Explain how neural networks learn,” which might give you a technically accurate but harder-to-grasp explanation\\n\\n**💡 Detailed report outline prompt example**:\\n\\nPlease provide an outline for a comprehensive report that analyzes the current trends in social media marketing for technology companies, focusing on the developments from 2025 onward. Include space for both established platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X, as well as emerging options like Bluesky and Threads.\\n\\nThe outline should include an introduction, three main sections addressing different aspects of social media trends, and a conclusion summarizing the findings. Please suggest the types of graphs that could illustrate user engagement trends and list bullet points that summarize key marketing strategies in each section.\\n\\n### [2. Supply the AI with examples](#2-supply-the-ai-with-examples)\\n\\nIncorporating examples into your prompts steers the AI’s responses in the desired direction. By providing examples as you write prompts, you set a precedent for the type of information or response you expect. This practice is particularly useful for complex tasks where the desired output might be ambiguous or for creative tasks with more than one relevant answer.\\n\\nWhen you supply the AI with examples, ensure they represent the quality and style of your desired result. This strategy clarifies your expectations and helps the AI model its responses after the examples provided, leading to more accurate and tailored outputs.\\n\\nHere are some example types you could provide to an AI to help guide it toward generating the best response possible:\\n\\n- **Sample texts**: Share excerpts reflecting the style, tone, and content you want the AI to replicate. For instance, if you’re writing a company newsletter, paste a previous edition and prompt: “Write next month’s newsletter update in this same voice and format.”\\n\\n- **Data formats**: To guide the AI’s output, provide specific data structures, such as table layouts or spreadsheet formats. You might include a sample row like “| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock |” and ask the model to populate the rest based on a product list you provide.\\n\\n- **Document templates**: Offer templates to ensure the AI’s response follows a desired structure and format. For a weekly status report, you could share your existing template with headers like “Accomplishments,” “Blockers,” and “Next Steps,” then ask the AI to fill it in based on your notes.\\n\\n- **Code snippets**: Provide code examples if you need help with programming tasks to ensure correct syntax and logic. If you want a [Python](/community/tutorials/python-tutorial) function that follows your team’s conventions, paste an existing function and prompt: “Write a new function that validates email addresses using the same structure and commenting style.”\\n\\n- **Graphs and charts examples**: If you’re asking the AI to create similar graphics, share samples of visual data representation. You might include a screenshot of a bar chart from a previous quarterly report with the prompt: “Generate the data and labels for a chart like this showing Q3 performance.”\\n\\n- **Marketing copy**: If you’re crafting marketing content, share ad copy that aligns with your brand’s voice for the AI to mimic. For example, paste a landing page headline and subhead from a previous product launch and prompt: “Write three variations of launch copy for our new API feature using this same tone and structure.”\\n\\n**💡 Comparison table prompt example**:\\n\\nCreate a comparison table for two project management tools, Tool A and Tool B.\\n\\nInclude the following categories: Price, Key Features, User Reviews, and Support Options. For instance, under Key Features, list things like ‘Task Assignment’, ‘Time Tracking’, and ‘File Sharing’.\\n\\nThe format should mirror something like this:\\n\\n| Feature | Tool A | Tool B |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Price | $X per user/month | $Y per user/month |\\n| Key Features | Task Assignment, Time Tracking, File Sharing | Task Assignment, Time Tracking, File Sharing |\\n| User Reviews | X stars | Y stars |\\n| Support Options | 24/7 Live Chat, Email | Business Hours Phone, Email |\\n\\nPlease ensure the table is concise and suitable for inclusion in a business report.\\n\\n### [3. Get better answers by providing data](#3-get-better-answers-by-providing-data)\\n\\nMost LLMs now allow you to attach documents, images, spreadsheets, and other files directly to your prompts—and many also connect to tools like Google Drive, Notion, or GitHub to pull in context automatically. This makes it easy to incorporate specific data into your prompts… However, just because you can connect these tools doesn’t mean you should give unfettered access to all your business and personal files. Be selective: only share what’s necessary for the task at hand, and check whether your data might be used for model training—most platforms let you [opt out of this in settings](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).\\n\\nWith [AI privacy](/resources/articles/ai-and-privacy) in mind, incorporating data into prompts improves the quality of AI-generated responses, providing a solid foundation for the AI to understand the context and craft precise answers. Provide data that includes numerical values, dates, or categories, organized in a clear and structured way. Also, remember to give context to the data and, when possible, to cite its source. When you give the AI concrete data with clear context, it does more than summarize—it analyzes trends, spots patterns, and surfaces insights you might have missed. This is especially valuable for tasks like financial analysis, market research, or performance reporting, where the output needs to be grounded in real numbers rather than general observations.\\n\\nIf you need to work with a specific set of documents rather than the entire web, tools like [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) let you upload your own files and get citation-backed responses grounded only in that material. For a broader look at research-focused AI tools that handle documents and data differently than general chatbots, check out our guide to [Perplexity alternatives](/resources/articles/perplexity-alternatives).\\n\\n**💡 Quarterly sales analysis prompt example**:\\n\\nPlease analyze the sales data from the first quarter of 2025 provided in the attached PDF document. I need a summary that identifies our best-selling product, the overall sales trend, and any notable patterns in customer purchases.\\n\\nThe PDF contains detailed monthly sales units for three products: Product A, Product B, and Product C. After reviewing the data, summarize your findings in a concise paragraph that is suitable for a weekly business review. Highlight significant increases or decreases in sales and offer insights into potential factors driving these trends.\\n\\n### [4. Specify your desired output](#4-specify-your-desired-output)\\n\\nWhether you’re chatting with [Gemini or ChatGPT](/resources/articles/gemini-vs-chatgpt), articulate the precise format and structure you expect in the response. Specify whether you require a detailed report, a summary, bullet points, or a narrative form to ensure the AI tailors its output to your needs. For instance, a prompt like “Give me a bulleted list of key takeaways” will produce something very different from “Write this up as a two-paragraph executive summary.”\\n\\nIndicate any preferences such as tone, style, and the inclusion of certain elements like headings or subheadings. If you need a specific structure—like a blog post with an H1, three H2 sections, and a conclusion—say so explicitly rather than hoping the model infers it. By clearly defining your desired output, you guide the AI to deliver information that aligns with your intended use.\\n\\n**💡 Historical timeline prompt example**:\\n\\nCreate a comprehensive overview of the key milestones in the history of software development. The output should be structured as a timeline with bullet points, each bullet including the year, the milestone event, and a brief description of its significance. Start from the 1980s. The tone should be educational. Please limit the overview to twenty major milestones to maintain conciseness.\\n\\n### [5. Provide instructions on what to do instead of what *not* to do](#5-provide-instructions-on-what-to-do-instead-of-what-_not_-to-do)\\n\\nWhile LLMs continue to evolve and improve, they still stumble on negated prompts—instructions telling them what not to do, like “avoid bullet points.” A [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12711) conducted by researchers at KAIST found that larger models actually perform worse on these types of instructions, struggling more than smaller models to process negative framing. When constructing prompts for AI, it’s more effective to direct the system toward the desired action rather than detailing what it should avoid. This positive instruction approach reduces ambiguity and focuses the AI’s processing power on generating constructive outcomes.\\n\\nNegative instructions often require the AI to interpret and invert them, increasing the cognitive load and potential for misunderstanding. By clearly stating the intended actions, you enable the AI to apply its capabilities directly to fulfilling the task at hand, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the response.\\n\\n**💡 Positive instruction framing prompt examples**:\\n\\n- Avoid: \\\"Don’t write too much detail. → Use Instead: “Please provide a concise summary.”\\n\\n- Avoid: “Don’t use technical jargon.” → Use Instead: “Write with clear and simple language accessible to a general audience.”\\n\\n- Avoid: “Don’t give examples from before the year 2000.” → Use Instead: “Provide examples from the year 2000 onwards.”\\n\\n### [6. Give the model a persona or frame of reference](#6-give-the-model-a-persona-or-frame-of-reference)\\n\\nPersona prompting is a technique in its own right, but it also complements other strategies, such as few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning. By assigning the model a specific identity or expertise, you shape the tone, vocabulary, and depth of the response to match your needs.\\n\\nThis works across use cases:\\n\\n- **For generating images**: “You are a fine art photographer with a focus on dramatic lighting.”\\n\\n- **For coding**: “You are a senior backend engineer reviewing this Python script for security vulnerabilities.”\\n\\n- **For writing**: “You are a tech journalist explaining this concept to a non-technical audience.”\\n\\nThe persona sets expectations and helps the model calibrate its output to the task at hand.\\n\\n**💡 Product manager persona prompt example**:\\n\\nYou are a senior technical product manager preparing for customer discovery interviews. Based on the attached product requirements document, draft a list of 10 open-ended questions to ask prospective users about their current workflow pain points and feature priorities.\\n\\nFocus on questions that will surface unmet needs without leading the respondent toward a specific answer. Keep the tone conversational but professional.\\n\\n### [7. Try a prompt optimizer tool](#7-try-a-prompt-optimizer-tool)\\n\\nIf you’re running the same prompt repeatedly—for data extraction, content generation, or any structured task—consider using a prompt optimizer to automatically improve it. These tools test variations of your prompt, evaluate the results against your criteria, and iteratively refine the instructions until performance improves. The process is similar to what you’d do manually, but faster and more systematic: the optimizer proposes changes, measures their effectiveness, and retains the best-performing versions.\\n\\nHere are some prompt optimization tools to explore:\\n\\n- [DSPy (with GEPA optimizer)](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy): Open-source framework that treats prompts as learnable parameters and uses reflection-based optimization.\\n\\n- [OpenAI Prompt Optimizer](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-optimizer): Built-in tool for refining prompts using your own datasets.\\n\\n- [Opik Agent Optimizer](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/agent_optimization/algorithms/metaprompt_optimizer): Supports multiple optimization algorithms, including evolutionary and Bayesian approaches.\\n\\n- [LangWatch](https://langwatch.ai/prompt-optimizer): LLM ops platform with prompt optimization studio.\\n\\n- [PromptPerfect](https://promptperfect.jina.ai/): Automatic optimization for text and image model prompts.\\n\\nEven if you’re not ready to run an optimizer yourself, the takeaway still applies: treat prompt engineering as an iterative process, and don’t be afraid to test multiple variations to find what works best.\\n\\nExplore how [DSPy replaces manual prompt tuning](/community/tutorials/prompting-with-dspy) with declarative programs, adaptive modules, and built-in optimizers that improve language model behavior through compilation. See practical examples of question answering and retrieval-augmented pipelines that show measurable gains in accuracy with minimal training data.\\n\\n### [8. Split complex tasks into simpler ones](#8-split-complex-tasks-into-simpler-ones)\\n\\nWhen dealing with complex tasks, breaking them into simpler, more manageable components (or prompt chaining) makes them more approachable for an LLM. This applies to everything from writing a multi-section report to building a financial model, debugging a codebase, developing a content calendar, or drafting a legal contract. Using step-by-step instructions helps prevent the AI from becoming overwhelmed and ensures that each part of the task is handled with attention to detail.\\n\\nAdditionally, this approach allows for easier monitoring and adjustment of each step, facilitating better quality control throughout the process. By compartmentalizing tasks, the AI also uses its resources more efficiently, allocating the necessary attention where it’s most needed.\\n\\n**💡 Task breakdown prompt example**:\\n\\nAvoid a single broad prompt:\\n\\n- “Write a 1500-word article on the impact of AI on remote work.”\\n\\n\\nTry an initial prompt and follow-up prompts instead:\\n\\n1. “Develop a detailed outline for a 1500-word article titled ‘Revolutionizing Remote Work: The Role of AI for Tech Professionals.’ The outline should include an engaging introduction, three main sections titled ‘Enhancing Productivity with AI Tools,’ ‘AI-Driven Communication Optimization,’ and ‘Advanced Project Management through AI,’ plus a conclusion that offers a perspective on future developments.”\\n\\n2. “Compose a detailed introduction for the article ‘Revolutionizing Remote Work: The Role of AI for Tech Professionals.’ The introduction should be 150-200 words, setting the stage for how AI is changing the game for remote workers in the tech industry, and providing a hook that will entice tech professionals to continue reading.”\\n\\n### [9. Understand the model’s shortcomings](#9-understand-the-model-s-shortcomings)\\n\\nIn crafting prompts for an AI, recognize the model’s limitations to set realistic expectations. Prompting AI to perform tasks it’s not designed for—or expecting certainty where it only offers probabilities—will lead to frustration and potentially misleading outputs.\\n\\nHere are some known shortcomings of AI models:\\n\\n- **Hallucinations are inherent, not a bug**: LLMs predict the next most likely word based on patterns—they don’t verify truth. When uncertain, they often generate plausible-sounding but fabricated information.\\n\\n- **Context window limits affect long inputs**: Models only process a fixed number of tokens at once. In long documents or conversations, earlier context may get lost, leading to contradictions or forgotten details—a phenomenon sometimes called the “[lost in the middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172)” effect.\\n\\n- **Training data has a cutoff**: Models don’t have access to events or information after their training cutoff date unless they search the web or access external tools.\\n\\n- **Confidence doesn’t equal accuracy**: A model often sounds equally confident about correct facts and complete fabrications. High confidence in a response is not a reliable indicator of correctness, so it remains important to validate facts yourself.\\n\\n- **Complex reasoning compounds errors**: In multi-step tasks, small errors early on may snowball into larger inaccuracies by the end—especially in longer outputs or chain-of-thought reasoning.\\n\\n- **Nuance and ambiguity are challenging**: Sarcasm, cultural references, and domain-specific jargon often trip up even advanced models, leading to misinterpretations or overly literal responses.\\n\\n- **Training data reflects societal biases**: Models trained on internet text absorb [biases](/resources/articles/ai-bias) around race, gender, political ideology, geographic regions, and economic status. The result can be outputs that favor certain perspectives or make unwarranted assumptions about demographics and context.\\n\\n### [10. Take an experimental approach to prompting](#10-take-an-experimental-approach-to-prompting)\\n\\nPrompt engineering has evolved from a niche skill to a more established discipline, characterized by dedicated research, published best practices, and a growing library of techniques. But it’s still a field where experimentation pays off. The best practices in this guide—and others online—are a starting point, not a ceiling. These tools have only been commercially available for a couple of years, which means there are no established experts—just early practitioners learning alongside everyone else. You’ll often discover techniques specific to your use case, your model, or your workflow that aren’t documented anywhere.\\n\\nTest your prompts iteratively. Small changes in wording, structure, or instruction order alter the output, and you’ll only learn how a model responds by trying things out. What works for code generation in Claude might not work the same way in [GPT-5](/resources/articles/gpt-5-overview) and a prompt that produces great results for image generation in Midjourney might need a completely different approach in DALL-E. Keep notes on what works and what doesn’t across different models and tasks—whether you’re writing marketing copy, debugging Python scripts, or generating product visuals—and don’t be afraid to deviate from established patterns if you find something that performs better.\\n\\n## [Defensive prompt engineering](#defensive-prompt-engineering)\\n\\nIf you’re [building AI products](/resources/articles/building-ai-products) that accept user input and pass it to an LLM, you need to think about prompt injection—a type of attack where malicious inputs manipulate the model into ignoring its original instructions or revealing sensitive information. This isn’t just a concern for developers building [AI chatbots](/resources/articles/ai-agent-vs-ai-chatbot); it applies to any workflow where untrusted text gets processed by a model, from document summarizers to [AI-powered search tools](/resources/articles/ai-search-engines-for-research).\\n\\nThe following tactics help reduce your exposure, though no single defense is foolproof—layering multiple approaches provides the strongest protection.\\n\\n- **Use delimiters to separate instructions from user input**: Wrapping user-provided content in clear markers like ###, “”\\\", or XML tags helps the model distinguish between your system instructions and the data it should process. Pair this with instructions telling the model to treat the delimited content as inert data, not commands to follow.\\n\\n- **Sanitize and validate inputs before they reach the model**: Scan incoming text for suspicious patterns like “ignore previous instructions,” “forget your rules,” or attempts to inject your own delimiter characters. Filtering known attack phrases and rejecting abnormally long or strangely formatted inputs adds friction for anyone trying to manipulate the system.\\n\\n- **Apply the principle of least privilege**: Restrict your LLM application’s access to only the data sources and actions it genuinely needs, and use the lowest permissions possible. This doesn’t prevent prompt injection, but it limits the damage if an attack succeeds.\\n\\n- **Audit outputs before acting on them**: If your LLM generates commands, code, or API calls, validate those outputs through rule-based checks or a secondary classifier before executing them. Treating the model’s output as untrusted—just like user input—prevents a successful injection from cascading into your systems.\\n\\n- **Test your prompts adversarially**: Run red-team exercises where you actively try to break your own system using known injection techniques, jailbreak patterns, and edge cases. Regularly testing with inputs like “Ignore all above instructions and…” helps you identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.\\n\\n## [Prompt engineering best practices FAQs](#prompt-engineering-best-practices-faqs)\\n\\n**What is the difference between few-shot and zero-shot prompting?**\\n\\nZero-shot prompting is when you give the AI a direct instruction without any examples, relying on the model to understand and complete the task from the instruction alone. Few-shot prompting involves providing one or more input-output examples before your actual request, which helps the model learn the format, tone, or style you’re looking for. Few-shot prompting is particularly useful when you need consistent formatting or when the task involves subtle patterns that are easier to show than describe.\\n\\n**Do I need to know how to code to use prompt engineering?**\\n\\nNo—the core techniques are about communicating clearly with the model, not technical expertise. In fact, creatives often excel at prompt engineering because they’re practiced at describing concepts, setting tone, and iterating on feedback. That said, coding knowledge helps when you’re working with structured outputs like JSON, using the API directly, or building prompts into automated workflows.\\n\\n**Can prompt engineering help reduce AI hallucinations?**\\n\\nYes, several techniques help. Providing relevant data or context gives the model a factual foundation to work from, and explicitly giving the model permission to say “I don’t know” reduces the likelihood of fabricated answers. Chain-of-thought prompting also helps because it forces the model to show its work, making errors easier to spot.\\n\\n**What are common mistakes to avoid in prompt engineering?**\\n\\nBeing too vague is one of the most common issues—asking for “a summary” without specifying length, format, or focus leaves too much room for interpretation. Other frequent mistakes include overloading a single prompt with multiple unrelated tasks, using negative instructions instead of positive framing, and skipping iteration rather than testing and refining based on results.\\n\\n**What are the risks of prompt injection, and how do I prevent them?**\\n\\nPrompt injection occurs when malicious or accidental input manipulates an LLM into ignoring its original instructions or revealing sensitive information. To reduce risk, use delimiters to separate system instructions from user input, sanitize inputs for suspicious patterns, and validate the model’s outputs before acting on them.\\n\\n## [Build with DigitalOcean’s Gradient Platform](#build-with-digitalocean-s-gradient-platform)\\n\\n[DigitalOcean Gradient Platform](/products/gradientai/platform) makes it easier to build and deploy AI agents without managing complex infrastructure.

Crafting a precise prompt can be the difference between hours of debugging and a seamless implementation. The key is to clearly communicate your intent and requirements, because an AI doesn't inherently know your goals – it only follows the patterns described in your prompt. This guide introduces language-agnostic prompt engineering techniques to help both beginners and experienced developers get more accurate and useful code from AI. We'll illustrate each technique with examples of weak vs. improved prompts to show how small changes can yield better results. For a deeper dive into how AI code review works, see our [guide on AI code review](https://graphite.com/guides/ai-code-review).\\n\\n### Be specific with language and requirements[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#be-specific-with-language-and-requirements)\\n\\nThe first rule of prompt engineering for code is to be specific about what you want. Vague prompts yield vague (often incorrect) results. Always mention the programming language, the task or algorithm, and any requirements or constraints. For example, consider asking an AI to generate a sorting algorithm:\\n\\n- **Weak prompt:** \\\"Write a sorting algorithm.\\\"\\n- **Improved prompt:** \\\"Write a **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** implementation of **merge sort** optimized for **memory efficiency**, including **time complexity analysis** and **error handling** for edge cases (e.g. empty arrays).\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe improved prompt is much clearer. It specifies:\\n\\n- The programming language (Python) and specific algorithm (merge sort).\\n- The optimization goal (memory efficiency) and required output details (time complexity analysis).\\n- Error handling expectations and an edge case to consider (empty arrays).\\n\\n\\nBy spelling out these details, you greatly reduce ambiguity. [Microsoft's Developer Tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/) research group observed that prompts with explicit specifications reduced the need for back-and-forth refinements by 68%. In practice, this means the AI is more likely to produce correct, ready-to-use code on the first try.\\n\\nBeing specific also means providing technical context when relevant. If certain constraints matter – such as the target environment, API version, performance or security requirements – include them in the prompt. For instance, specify \\\"Node.js 18 server environment\\\" or \\\"Python 3.10+\\\" if it matters. Otherwise, the model might generate code that is technically correct but not suitable for your situation.\\n> **Tip:** AI code review tools like [Graphite Agent](https://graphite.com/features/agent) can help enforce technical requirements and catch missing context.\\n\\n### Include examples and constraints[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#include-examples-and-constraints)\\n\\nAnother powerful technique is to provide examples or test cases in your prompt. Examples act as implicit constraints, guiding the model toward the format or behavior you expect. For instance, if you want a function with a specific signature or output format, show a snippet of that.\\n\\nImagine you need an email validation function. A weak prompt might just say, \\\"Validate an email address.\\\" An improved prompt would describe requirements and give a usage example, e.g.:\\n> **Prompt:** \\\"Create a TypeScript function `validateEmail(email: string): {isValid: boolean; message: string}` that checks if an email is RFC-5322 compliant and rejects disposable domains. For example, if the input is `\\\"test@tempmail.com\\\"`, it should return an object like `{ isValid: false, message: 'Disposable domain not allowed' }`.\\\"\\n\\nIn this improved version, the prompt lists specific rules (RFC compliance and no disposable domains) and provides a clear function signature and an example of expected output. This gives the AI a template to follow and boundaries to respect. As Dr. Rachel Thomas of fast.ai notes, *\\\"examples in prompts serve as implicit constraints that guide the model toward the desired output format.\\\"* By including a small example or an outline of the output, you help the model understand exactly what you want.\\n\\n### Break down complex tasks and iterate[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#break-down-complex-tasks-and-iterate)\\n\\nIf your desired output is complex, avoid requesting everything in one huge prompt. It's often better to break down a complex task into smaller steps or use an iterative approach. Large models can handle reasonably detailed prompts, but asking for a full application in one go is likely to produce a convoluted or partial answer. Instead, tackle complex tasks in stages and possibly across multiple prompts:\\n\\n1. **Decompose the problem:** Outline sub-tasks in separate prompts (e.g. first define the data model, then the API endpoints, then the UI components). This ensures each part is handled with focus.\\n2. **Use step-by-step reasoning:** You can actually instruct the model to \\\"think step by step.\\\" For example: \\\"I need a JavaScript function to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Let's solve this step by step: first explain the concept, then choose an algorithm (greedy vs DP), then write the code, then analyze complexity.\\\" By embedding this reasoning process in the prompt, you encourage the AI to work through the problem methodically.\\n3. **Iterate with the AI:** Treat the AI's first output as a draft. Review it, then issue follow-up prompts to refine the code.\\n\\n\\nBy breaking prompts into smaller pieces or sequential turns, you make it easier for the model to comply at each step. You also get opportunities to catch mistakes early and steer the output in the right direction. Remember that you can carry context between prompts (in a chat-based LLM) – use that to your advantage for iterative improvement.\\n\\nFor more information on [integrating AI into your code review workflow](https://graphite.com/guides/integrating-ai-code-review-workflow) and [how to review code written by AI](https://graphite.com/guides/how-to-review-code-written-by-ai), these guides offer practical advice for iterative, AI-assisted development.\\n\\n### Avoid common prompting pitfalls[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#avoid-common-prompting-pitfalls)\\n\\nWhile applying the above techniques, watch out for a few common mistakes that can undermine your results:\\n\\n- **Under-specifying the task:** Don't assume the AI \\\"knows\\\" what you intended. If a prompt is too minimal, the model might solve the wrong problem or omit important features. Always double-check that your prompt fully describes the problem.\\n- **Ignoring context or constraints:** Failing to mention the operating environment, framework, or performance/security constraints can result in code that doesn't fit your project needs. Also make sure to include any version requirements or security considerations. Without this, you might get code that technically works but is impractical or unsafe for your use case. The more context you give, the more relevant the output.\\n- **Over-reliance on AI without verification:** Even with good prompts, AI-generated code isn't guaranteed to be perfect. The model might produce subtle logic bugs, use deprecated APIs, or just take an unconventional approach. Never merge AI-written code into production without reviewing it. Treat the AI as a coding assistant, not an infallible coder. Write prompts that encourage best practices (like asking for safe, idiomatic code), and always test and review the output thoroughly. Using linters or static analysis on AI code is also a smart safeguard.\\n> **To compare approaches:** This guide, [Automated vs. manual code reviews: Finding the right balance](https://graphite.com/guides/automated-vs-manual-code-reviews), explores the strengths and limitations of both, and how to combine them for best results.\\n\\nBy avoiding these pitfalls, you ensure that prompt engineering remains a helpful aid rather than a source of technical debt. Prompting is an iterative learning process – over time, you'll learn which clarifications or extra details yield better code from your preferred LLM.\\n\\n### Graphite Agent: AI code review for quality and consistency[/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency](/guides/better-prompts-ai-code#graphite-agent-ai-code-review-for-quality-and-consistency)\\n\\nWriting a good prompt is the first step, but ensuring the quality and consistency of AI-generated code is the next challenge.

But creating it manually is a time-consuming process. To save time and effort, AI prompt writing is a strategic approach to guiding AI tools to generate accurate, structured and helpful documentation quickly. By generating the right prompt, you can produce any type of document you want.\\n\\n![AI Prompt Writing for Documentation: Key Elements And Best Practices](https://betterdocs.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.jpeg \\\"AI Prompt Writing for Documentation: Key Elements And Best Practices 1\\\")\\n\\nIn this blog, you will learn how to generate an effective prompt for your documentation. You will also know more about some of the key elements that will help you to create an impactful and easy-to-understand document for your users. Let us dive in.\\n\\n## **What Is AI Prompt Writing for Documentation And Why Is It Important?**\\n\\nWriting prompts mean the context or instruction that you provide to the [**Artificial Intelligence for your documentation**](https://betterdocs.co/what-is-document-automation-guide/) to generate an entire document within minutes automatically. Before generating a document, it is essential to train the AI tool so that it can create accurate and adequate documentation for your knowledge base. The way of doing that is an effective prompt.\\n\\nCreating and managing a knowledge base requires a lot of time. Especially if it is a large company or a business niche, creating a knowledge base can be a hectic process. Writing, editing, and updating each document to the brand tone is a time-consuming process. But with the help of AI, it can be done within minutes. Now, with a simple instruction, you can generate thousands of documents in a few minutes. This saves a lot of time and allows you to focus more on creating new products or ideating for your business.\\n\\n## **Key Elements of Writing Prompts**\\n\\nBefore jumping into how to create and write an effective AI prompt, first, you must understand the key elements that are required to make proper documentation. Mainly, there are 4 key elements. **Character, Intention, Scenario and Delivery**. Let us take a deeper look at each of these elements.\\n\\n**Character:** The prompt needs a proper character. This helps AI to better understand from which perception the document is being generated. Giving a character helps AI to better understand who is generating this document and the viewpoint of that persona. For example, while generating a document for a SaaS tool, if it is mentioned in the prompt to imagine the AI itself as a marketer, then it will get a clear idea while generating the document.\\n\\n**Intention:** The  next key element is the intention. This intention actually refers to the task you want your AI to perform. Here, you have to be very specific about the instructions and what you want to see in the document. For instance, while writing a documentation for a vendor, it is important to mention which type of content you want to show the vendor and what the most important keywords or lines are that you want to add to your documentation.\\n\\n![Key elements of effect AI prompt](https://betterdocs.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.png \\\"AI Prompt Writing for Documentation: Key Elements And Best Practices 2\\\")\\n\\n**Scenario:** Scenario is one of the most crucial elements for documentation. For which situation is the documentation being created? If it is for installing a product, or it is for a specific pricing plan. A proper scenario explains and clarifies the AI in a better way to get targeted results. So the scenario must be clear and concise, that the documentation can be generated properly.\\n\\n**Delivery:** The final element is delivery. It is the look of the documentation. What are the proper layouts and structure of the document? It matters the most when you want to align the prompt with your brand tone or your brand’s documentation structure. Specifying this delivery or output can help AI to better understand how it will modify the step-by-step lines or paragraphs for the document.\\n\\n## **How to Write AI Prompts That Generate Perfect Documentation?**\\n\\nNow, the elements have been cleared out, it is time to get into action to generate the prompt. For writing an advanced AI prompt for documentation, it is a must to maintain some of the key processes. Let us have a look at this section to see what some of the most effective processes are.\\n\\n### **Specify the Goal**\\n\\nBefore jumping into writing the prompt, specify the goal. What type of document do you want to create with AI, and what will be the main output of generating the document with AI? By setting up a clear goal, it will be easier for you to create a prompt that will be effective for the documentation. For example, if you want to generate the installation process of a software, then before writing the prompt, specify what you want to see in the document, how many steps should be there, what type of instructions you want to show in your document, etc.\\n\\n### **Add a Context**\\n\\nAfter specifying the goal, add a proper context. Give the AI a situation or scenario. In which specific context do you want to generate this type of document? For instance, suppose you already have a document on how to install software. But now, you want to create another document on how to integrate an API key. So, give the context of why it will be easier and how it can be an alternative to installing the software.\\n\\n### **Be Clear And Concise**\\n\\nWhile writing a prompt, be clear and concise about what type of output you want to see in the document. What are your [**specific requirements**](https://betterdocs.co/different-requirements-documentation-guide/) for documentation? Give the prompt a clear idea of it. “*Write about the pricing section of the iPhone”* is a vague prompt for documentation. Rather, be clear about what type of model you want to talk about, if there is any special pricing offer, what are the specific features of that phone, etc, to become clear and concise about the document.\\n\\n### **Place the Keywords**\\n\\nPlacing keywords properly can help your documentation rank higher in the search results. So make sure you give instructions to AI to place the keyword in the document. To do that, add the list of keywords to the prompt. It is best to mention which part you want to implement the keywords in. Which keywords do you want to place in the heading and which ones do you want to show inside the paragraphs? You can generate these keywords through ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini to get an idea about them.\\n\\nIf you are managing documentation in WordPress, you can use plugins like **BetterDocs**. In its ‘[**Write with AI**](https://betterdocs.co/write-documentation-with-ai-in-betterdocs/)‘ feature, you will find a field to put the keywords so the AI can automatically place the keywords inside your document.\\n\\n![AI Prompt Writing for Documentation: Key Elements And Best Practices](https://betterdocs.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7.gif \\\"AI Prompt Writing for Documentation: Key Elements And Best Practices 3\\\")\\n\\n### **Define the Output**\\n\\nWith a clear goal, define the clear output. What should be the outcome of the document? What is the end goal that you want your users to achieve through the documentation? This output helps AI to better understand the flow and how it can finalize maintaining proper flow. In the prompt, add what the final output or the final goal of the document is.\\n\\n### **Add an Example**\\n\\nIn your prompt, add an example of your documentation. If you have an existing knowledge base, then take an example from there and put it into your prompt. This way, the AI will better understand the writing structure and thus it can generate the entire document based on that. With one prompt, create an entire document within minutes.\\n\\n### **Review And Edit**\\n\\n![Review and edit the documentation](https://betterdocs.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1.png \\\"AI Prompt Writing for Documentation: Key Elements And Best Practices 4\\\")\\n\\nEven though you can generate the entire document, AI is not totally error-free. There might be slight errors in the document, which might be misleading for many users. So you have to make sure to thoroughly check the entire document. After checking the document correctly, please review it and edit it. Check if there are any typos or grammatical errors that might impact the readability. Also, make sure it maintains the brand tone you want in the documentation.\\n\\n## **Good Prompt vs Bad Prompt for Documentation: What Makes the Difference?**\\n\\nEffective AI documentation starts with effective prompting. Let us compare a good prompt vs a bad prompt and understand what sets them apart.\\n\\n| **Bad Prompt** | **Good Prompt** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Write a documentation on installing software | You are a technical writer creating onboarding documentation for beginners. Write a step-by-step installation guide for a desktop application called *[Software Name]*. Include system requirements, installation steps for both Windows and macOS, troubleshooting tips for common installation errors, and a summary at the end. Here are the detailed requirements: *[Adding software requirements].* Include the following SEO keywords naturally throughout the documentation:software installation guide, how to install software on Windows, macOS software installation, beginner software tutorial. |\\n\\nLooking at the above table, there are some comparisons. In the bad prompt, there are not many details, so the AI will not understand what type of installation documentation it has to generate. So it will give an output of generic software installation.\\n\\nBut on the good prompt, there is an added persona, with the details requirement of it. What type of system requirements are needed and what type of personality does the AI have to think about itself? Based on that, the AI will generate properly SEO optimized documentation.\\n\\n## **Some Effective AI Prompts Examples for Documentation**\\n\\nNow you know the best ways to write an advanced AI prompt for your documentation. To make the process even easier, you can take inspiration from the examples below. Based on each business niche, these examples are generated and you can edit them on your own. Here are some of those:\\n\\n**![🤖](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/svg/1f916.svg) SaaS (Software as a Service):**\\n\\n*“You are a technical writer for a SaaS company.

These tools can autocomplete functions, suggest bug fixes, and even generate entire modules or MVPs. Yet, as many of us have learned, the *quality* of the AI’s output depends largely on the *quality of the prompt* you provide. In other words, **prompt engineering** has become an essential skill. A poorly phrased request can yield irrelevant or generic answers, while a well-crafted prompt can produce thoughtful, accurate, and even creative code solutions. This write-up takes a practical look at how to systematically craft effective prompts for common development tasks.\\n\\nAI pair programmers are powerful but not magical – they have no prior knowledge of your specific project or intent beyond what you tell them or include as context. The more information you provide, the better the output. We’ll distill key prompt patterns, **repeatable frameworks**, and memorable examples that have resonated with developers. You’ll see side-by-side comparisons of **good vs. bad prompts** with actual AI responses, along with commentary to understand why one succeeds where the other falters. **Here’s a cheat sheet to get started:**\\n\\n[https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H4uo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe144e78-4d86-45c9-bc61-28836dee7265_1784x2346.png](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H4uo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe144e78-4d86-45c9-bc61-28836dee7265_1784x2346.png)\\n\\nPrompting an AI coding tool is somewhat like communicating with a very literal, *sometimes* knowledgeable collaborator. To get useful results, you need to set the stage clearly and guide the AI on *what* you want and *how* you want it.\\n\\nBelow are foundational principles that underpin all examples in this playbook:\\n\\n- **Provide rich context.** Always assume the AI knows nothing about your project beyond what you provide. Include relevant details such as the programming language, framework, and libraries, as well as the specific function or snippet in question. If there’s an error, provide the exact error message and describe what the code is *supposed* to do. **Specificity** and **context** make the difference between vague suggestions and precise, actionable solutions . In practice, this means your prompt might include a brief setup like: “I have a Node.js function using Express and Mongoose that should fetch a user by ID, but it throws a TypeError. Here’s the code and error…”. The more setup you give, the less the AI has to guess.\\n\\n- **Be specific about your goal or question.** Vague queries lead to vague answers. Instead of asking something like “Why isn’t my code working?”, pinpoint what insight you need. For example: “This JavaScript function is returning undefined instead of the expected result. Given the code below, can you help identify why and how to fix it?” is far more likely to yield a helpful answer. One prompt formula for debugging is: *“It’s expected to do [expected behavior] but instead it’s doing [current behavior] when given [example input]. Where is the bug?”* . Similarly, if you want an optimization, ask for a *specific kind* of optimization (e.g. *“How can I improve the runtime performance of this sorting function for 10k items?”*). Specificity guides the AI’s focus .\\n\\n- **Break down complex tasks.** When implementing a new feature or tackling a multi-step problem, don’t feed the entire problem in one gigantic prompt. It’s often more effective to split the work into smaller chunks and iterate. For instance, *“First, generate a React component skeleton for a product list page. Next, we’ll add state management. Then, we’ll integrate the API call.”* Each prompt builds on the previous. It’s often not advised to ask for a whole large feature in one go; instead, start with a high-level goal and then iteratively ask for each piece . This approach not only keeps the AI’s responses focused and manageable, but also mirrors how a human would incrementally build a solution.\\n\\n- **Include examples of inputs/outputs or expected behavior.** If you can illustrate what you want with an example, do it. For example, *“Given the array [3,1,4], this function should return [1,3,4].”* Providing a concrete example in the prompt helps the AI understand your intent and reduces ambiguity . It’s akin to giving a junior developer a quick test case – it clarifies the requirements. In prompt engineering terms, this is sometimes called “**few-shot prompting**,” where you show the AI a pattern to follow. Even one example of correct behavior can guide the model’s response significantly.\\n\\n- **Leverage roles or personas.** A powerful technique popularized in many viral prompt examples is to ask the AI to “act as” a certain persona or role. This can influence the style and depth of the answer. For instance, *“Act as a senior React developer and review my code for potential bugs”* or *“You are a JavaScript performance expert. Optimize the following function.”* By setting a role, you prime the assistant to adopt the relevant tone – whether it’s being a strict code reviewer, a helpful teacher for a junior dev, or a security analyst looking for vulnerabilities. Community-shared prompts have shown success with this method, such as *“Act as a JavaScript error handler and debug this function for me. The data isn’t rendering properly from the API call.”* . In our own usage, we must still provide the code and problem details, but the **role-play** prompt can yield more structured and expert-level guidance.\\n\\n[https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iNaV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd499f2e8-258d-4c0b-abe8-11e35f267832_1536x1024.png](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iNaV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd499f2e8-258d-4c0b-abe8-11e35f267832_1536x1024.png)\\n\\n- **Iterate and refine the conversation.** Prompt engineering is an *interactive* process, not a one-shot deal. Developers often need to review the AI’s first answer and then ask follow-up questions or make corrections. If the solution isn’t quite right, you might say, *“That solution uses recursion, but I’d prefer an iterative approach – can you try again without recursion?”* Or, *“Great, now can you improve the variable names and add comments?”* The AI remembers the context in a chat session, so you can progressively steer it to the desired outcome. The key is to view the AI as a partner you can coach – **progress over perfection** on the first try .\\n\\n- **Maintain code clarity and consistency.** This last principle is a bit indirect but very important for tools that work on your code context. Write clean, well-structured code and comments, even before the AI comes into play. Meaningful function and variable names, consistent formatting, and docstrings not only make your code easier to understand for humans, but also give the AI stronger clues about what you’re doing. If you show a consistent pattern or style, the AI will continue it . Treat these tools as extremely attentive junior developers – they take every cue from your code and comments.\\n\\nWith these foundational principles in mind, let’s dive into specific scenarios. We’ll start with **debugging**, perhaps the most immediate use-case: you have code that’s misbehaving, and you want the AI to help figure out why.\\n\\nDebugging is a natural fit for an AI assistant. It’s like having a rubber-duck that not only listens, but actually talks back with suggestions. However, success largely depends on how you present the problem to the AI. Here’s how to systematically prompt for help in finding and fixing bugs:\\n\\n**1. Clearly describe the problem and symptoms.** Begin your prompt by describing what is going wrong and what the code is supposed to do. Always include the exact error message or incorrect behavior. For example, instead of just saying “My code doesn’t work,” you might prompt: *“I have a function in JavaScript that should calculate the sum of an array of numbers, but it’s returning NaN (Not a Number) instead of the actual sum. Here is the code: [include code]. It should output a number (the sum) for an array of numbers like [1,2,3], but I’m getting NaN. What could be the cause of this bug?”* This prompt specifies the language, the intended behavior, the observed wrong output, and provides the code context – all crucial information. Providing a structured context (code + error + expected outcome + what you’ve tried) gives the AI a solid starting point . By contrast, a generic question like “Why isn’t my function working?” yields meager results – the model can only offer the most general guesses without context.\\n\\n**2. Use a step-by-step or line-by-line approach for tricky bugs.** For more complex logic bugs (where no obvious error message is thrown but the output is wrong), you can prompt the AI to walk through the code’s execution. For instance: *“Walk through this function line by line and track the value of total at each step. It’s not accumulating correctly – where does the logic go wrong?”* This is an example of a **rubber duck debugging prompt** – you’re essentially asking the AI to simulate the debugging process a human might do with prints or a debugger. Such prompts often reveal subtle issues like variables not resetting or incorrect conditional logic, because the AI will spell out the state at each step. If you suspect a certain part of the code, you can zoom in: *“Explain what the filter call is doing here, and if it might be excluding more items than it should.”* Engaging the AI in an explanatory role can surface the bug in the process of explanation.\\n\\n**3. Provide minimal reproducible examples when possible.** Sometimes your actual codebase is large, but the bug can be demonstrated in a small snippet. If you can extract or simplify the code that still reproduces the issue, do so and feed that to the AI. This not only makes it easier for the AI to focus, but also forces you to clarify the problem (often a useful exercise in itself). For example, if you’re getting a TypeError in a deeply nested function call, try to reproduce it with a few lines that you can share. Aim to isolate the bug with the minimum code, make an assumption about what’s wrong, test it, and iterate . You can involve the AI in this by saying: *“Here’s a pared-down example that still triggers the error [include snippet]. Why does this error occur?”* By simplifying, you remove noise and help the AI pinpoint the issue. (This technique mirrors the advice of many senior engineers: if you can’t immediately find a bug, simplify the problem space. The AI can assist in that analysis if you present a smaller case to it.)\\n\\n**4. Ask focused questions and follow-ups.** After providing context, it’s often effective to directly ask what you need, for example: *“What might be causing this issue, and how can I fix it?”* . This invites the AI to both diagnose and propose a solution. If the AI’s first answer is unclear or partially helpful, don’t hesitate to ask a follow-up. You could say, *“That explanation makes sense. Can you show me how to fix the code? Please provide the corrected code.”* In a chat setting, the AI has the conversation history, so it can directly output the modified code. If you’re using an inline tool like Copilot in VS Code or Cursor without a chat, you might instead write a comment above the code like // BUG: returns NaN, fix this function and see how it autocompletes – but in general, the interactive chat yields more thorough explanations. Another follow-up pattern: if the AI gives a fix but you don’t understand why, ask *“Can you explain why that change solves the problem?”* This way you learn for next time, and you double-check that the AI’s reasoning is sound.\\n\\nNow, let’s illustrate these debugging prompt principles with a concrete example, showing a **poor prompt vs. improved prompt** and the difference in AI responses:\\n\\nImagine we have a simple Node.js function meant to convert a list of user objects to a lookup map by user ID. However, it’s throwing an error. Here’s the buggy code:\\n\\n    // Buggy function: converts array of users to a map by ID\\n    function mapUsersById(users) {\\n      const userMap = {};\\n      for (let i = 0; i <= users.length; i++) {  \\n        // Note: using <= will go out of bounds on the last iteration\\n        const user = users[i];\\n        userMap[user.id] = user;\\n      }\\n      return userMap;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Example usage:\\n    const result = mapUsersById([{ id: 1, name: \\\"Alice\\\" }]);\\n\\nThis code is supposed to iterate through the users array and build an object where keys are user IDs. However, there is a bug: the loop uses i <= users.length instead of i < users.length. This will cause users[i] to be undefined on the last iteration, likely leading to a runtime error (e.g., attempting to access property id of undefined). Let’s see how an AI assistant might respond to two different prompts about this issue.\\n\\n**❌ Poor Prompt:** “Why isn’t my mapUsersById function working?”\\n\\n*AI’s response to the poor prompt (simulated):*\\n> *It’s hard to say without more information. Are you sure the function is being called with a proper array of users? Perhaps the issue is that users is empty or not an array, causing the loop not to execute properly. It could also be that there’s an error when setting the property on userMap. Make sure that each user has an id property. If users is undefined or null, that would also cause it to not work.*\\n\\n**Analysis:** This answer is quite vague. The prompt gave no details except the function name, so the AI is guessing at generic causes (“maybe the array is empty or not an array”, “make sure each user has an id”). It did not identify the actual bug. This is the kind of response you get when the question is underspecified – the model can only regurgitate common debugging tips. As a developer, this isn’t very helpful because it doesn’t address the real mistake. The **lack of context** and specificity in the prompt yields a generic answer (essentially the AI equivalent of “have you tried turning it off and on again?”). This aligns with the community advice that vague prompts lead to irrelevant or generic answers .\\n\\n**✅ Improved Prompt:** “I have a JavaScript function mapUsersById that should convert an array of user objects into a map (object) keyed by user ID. However, it throws an error when I run it. For example, when I pass [ {id: 1, name: \\\"Alice\\\"} ], I get TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined. Here is the function code:\\n\\n    function mapUsersById(users) {\\n      const userMap = {};\\n      for (let i = 0; i <= users.length; i++) {  \\n        const user = users[i];\\n        userMap[user.id] = user;\\n      }\\n      return userMap;\\n    }\\n\\nIt should return { \\\"1\\\": {id: 1, name: \\\"Alice\\\"} }. What is the bug and how can I fix it?”\\n\\n*AI’s response to the improved prompt (simulated):*\\n> *The error Cannot read property 'id' of undefined suggests that at some point, user is undefined, and then you try to access user.id. Looking at your loop, the issue is with the loop bounds. You are using i <= users.length. If users.length is 1 (for one user in the array), the loop runs with i = 0 and i = 1. When i is 1, users[1] is undefined (since the only index in the array is 0). Thus user becomes undefined on that iteration, and user.id throws a TypeError. The fix is to change the loop condition to i < users.length so that i goes from 0 to users.length-1. For example:\\n\\n    for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {\\n      const user = users[i];\\n      userMap[user.id] = user;\\n    }\\n> This way, i will be 0 for the first (and only) element, and then the loop stops. With that change, your function will no longer hit an undefined user and should work as expected, returning {\\\"1\\\": {id: 1, name: \\\"Alice\\\"}} for the given input.*\\n\\n**Analysis:** This response directly pinpoints the bug (using <= in the loop) and explains why it causes user to be undefined. It then provides the correct code solution (i < users.length) and confirms the expected outcome. The improved prompt succeeded because it followed our principles: it specified the language (JavaScript), described the function’s purpose, included the exact error message and a sample input, and even provided the code snippet in question. Notice how the AI used the error message as a clue to focus on the loop bounds – a targeted prompt enabled the AI to engage in true problem-solving, effectively simulating how a human debugger would think: “where could undefined come from? likely from the loop indexing”. This is a concrete demonstration of the benefit of detailed prompts.\\n\\n**Additional Debugging Tactics:** Beyond identifying obvious bugs, you can use prompt engineering for deeper debugging assistance:\\n\\n- *Ask for potential causes.* If you’re truly stumped, you can broaden the question slightly: *“What are some possible reasons for a TypeError: cannot read property 'foo' of undefined in this code?”* along with the code. The model might list a few scenarios (e.g. the object wasn’t initialized, a race condition, wrong variable scoping, etc.). This can give you angles to investigate that you hadn’t considered. It’s like brainstorming with a colleague.\\n\\n- *“Ask the Rubber Duck”* – i.e., explain your code to the AI. This may sound counterintuitive (why explain to the assistant?), but the act of writing an explanation can clarify your own understanding, and you can then have the AI verify or critique it. For example: *“I will explain what this function is doing: [your explanation]. Given that, is my reasoning correct and does it reveal where the bug is?”* The AI might catch a flaw in your explanation that points to the actual bug. This technique leverages the AI as an active rubber duck that not only listens but responds.\\n\\n- *Have the AI create test cases.* You can ask: *“Can you provide a couple of test cases (inputs) that might break this function?”* The assistant might come up with edge cases you didn’t think of (empty array, extremely large numbers, null values, etc.). This is useful both for debugging and for generating tests for future robustness.\\n\\n- *Role-play a code reviewer.* As an alternative to a direct “debug this” prompt, you can say: *“Act as a code reviewer. Here’s a snippet that isn’t working as expected. Review it and point out any mistakes or bad practices that could be causing issues: [code]”.* This sets the AI into a critical mode. Many developers find that phrasing the request as a code review yields a very thorough analysis, because the model will comment on each part of the code (and often, in doing so, it spots the bug). In fact, one prompt engineering tip is to explicitly request the AI to behave like a meticulous reviewer . This can surface not only the bug at hand but also other issues (e.g. potential null checks missing) which might be useful.\\n\\nIn summary, when debugging with an AI assistant, **detail and direction are your friends**. Provide the scenario, the symptoms, and then ask pointed questions. The difference between a flailing “it doesn’t work, help!” prompt and a surgical debugging prompt is night and day, as we saw above. Next, we’ll move on to another major use case: refactoring and improving existing code.\\n\\nRefactoring code – making it cleaner, faster, or more idiomatic without changing its functionality – is an area where AI assistants can shine. They’ve been trained on vast amounts of code, which includes many examples of well-structured, optimized solutions. However, to tap into that knowledge effectively, **your prompt must clarify what “better” means for your situation**. Here’s how to prompt for refactoring tasks:\\n\\n**1. State your refactoring goals explicitly.** “Refactor this code” on its own is too open-ended. Do you want to improve readability? Reduce complexity? Optimize performance? Use a different paradigm or library? The AI needs a target. A good prompt frames the task, for example: *“Refactor the following function to improve its readability and maintainability (reduce repetition, use clearer variable names).”* Or *“Optimize this algorithm for speed – it’s too slow on large inputs.”* By stating **specific goals**, you help the model decide which transformations to apply . For instance, telling it you care about performance might lead it to use a more efficient sorting algorithm or caching, whereas focusing on readability might lead it to break a function into smaller ones or add comments. If you have multiple goals, list them out. A prompt template from the Strapi guide suggests even enumerating issues: *“Issues I’d like to address: 1) [performance issue], 2) [code duplication], 3) [outdated API usage].”* . This way, the AI knows exactly what to fix. Remember, it will not inherently know *what you consider a problem* in the code – you must tell it.\\n\\n**2. Provide the necessary code context.** When refactoring, you’ll typically include the code snippet that needs improvement in the prompt. It’s important to include the full function or section that you want to be refactored, and sometimes a bit of surrounding context if relevant (like the function’s usage or related code, which could affect how you refactor). Also mention the language and framework, because “idiomatic” code varies between, say, idiomatic Node.js vs. idiomatic Deno, or React class components vs. functional components. For example: *“I have a React component written as a class. Please refactor it to a functional component using Hooks.”* The AI will then apply the typical steps (using useState, useEffect, etc.). If you just said “refactor this React component” without clarifying the style, the AI might not know you specifically wanted Hooks.\\n\\n- **Include version or environment details if relevant.** For instance, *“This is a Node.js v14 codebase”* or *“We’re using ES6 modules”*. This can influence whether the AI uses certain syntax (like import/export vs. require), which is part of a correct refactoring. If you want to ensure it doesn’t introduce something incompatible, mention your constraints.\\n\\n**3. Encourage explanations along with the code.** A great way to learn from an AI-led refactor (and to verify its correctness) is to ask for an explanation of the changes. For example: *“Please suggest a refactored version of the code, and explain the improvements you made.”* This was even built into the prompt template we referenced: *“…suggest refactored code with explanations for your changes.”* . When the AI provides an explanation, you can assess if it understood the code and met your objectives. The explanation might say: “I combined two similar loops into one to reduce duplication, and I used a dictionary for faster lookups,” etc. If something sounds off in the explanation, that’s a red flag to examine the code carefully. In short, *use the AI’s ability to explain as a safeguard* – it’s like having the AI perform a code review on its own refactor.\\n\\n**4. Use role-play to set a high standard.** As mentioned earlier, asking the AI to act as a code reviewer or senior engineer can be very effective. For refactoring, you might say: *“Act as a seasoned TypeScript expert and refactor this code to align with best practices and modern standards.”* This often yields not just superficial changes, but more insightful improvements because the AI tries to live up to the “expert” persona. A popular example from a prompt guide is having the AI role-play a mentor: *“Act like an experienced Python developer mentoring a junior. Provide explanations and write docstrings. Rewrite the code to optimize it.”* . The result in that case was that the AI used a more efficient data structure (set to remove duplicates) and provided a one-line solution for a function that originally used a loop . The role-play helped it not only refactor but also explain *why* the new approach is better (in that case, using a set is a well-known optimization for uniqueness).\\n\\nNow, let’s walk through an example of refactoring to see how a prompt can influence the outcome. We will use a scenario in JavaScript (Node.js) where we have some less-than-ideal code and we want it improved.\\n\\nSuppose we have a function that makes two database calls and does some processing. It works, but it’s not pretty – there’s duplicated code and it’s hard to read. We’d like to refactor it for clarity and efficiency. Here’s the original code:\\n\\n    // Original function: Fetches two lists and processes them (needs refactoring)\\n    async function getCombinedData(apiClient) {\\n      // Fetch list of users\\n      const usersResponse = await apiClient.fetch('/users');\\n      if (!usersResponse.ok) {\\n        throw new Error('Failed to fetch users');\\n      }\\n      const users = await usersResponse.json();\\n      // Fetch list of orders\\n      const ordersResponse = await apiClient.fetch('/orders');\\n      if (!ordersResponse.ok) {\\n        throw new Error('Failed to fetch orders');\\n      }\\n      const orders = await ordersResponse.json();\\n      // Combine data (match user to orders)\\n      const result = [];\\n      for (let user of users) {\\n        const userOrders = orders.filter(o => o.userId === user.id);\\n        result.push({ user, orders: userOrders });\\n      }\\n      return result;\\n    }\\n\\nIssues in this code: We see duplicated fetch logic for users and orders (could be refactored into a helper or loop), lack of error detail (just a generic error message), and it could perhaps run the fetches in parallel to improve speed. Let’s see two prompting approaches:\\n\\n**❌ Prompt 1 (Underspecified):** “Refactor the above getCombinedData function.”\\n\\n*AI’s response to Prompt 1:*\\n> *Sure. Here’s a refactored version of getCombinedData:\\n\\n    async function getCombinedData(apiClient) {\\n      // Fetch users and orders in parallel\\n      const [usersResponse, ordersResponse] = await Promise.all([\\n        apiClient.fetch('/users'),\\n        apiClient.fetch('/orders')\\n      ]);\\n      if (!usersResponse.ok || !ordersResponse.ok) {\\n        throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');\\n      }\\n      const [users, orders] = await Promise.all([\\n        usersResponse.json(),\\n        ordersResponse.json()\\n      ]);\\n      // Map orders by userId for efficient lookup\\n      const ordersByUser = {};\\n      for (const order of orders) {\\n        if (!ordersByUser[order.userId]) {\\n          ordersByUser[order.userId] = [];\\n        }\\n        ordersByUser[order.userId].push(order);\\n      }\\n      // Combine data\\n      return users.map(user => ({\\n        user,\\n        orders: ordersByUser[user.id] || []\\n      }));\\n    }\\n> I fetched users and orders in parallel to improve performance. I also consolidated error handling and used a map (ordersByUser) to group orders by user, which makes the combination step cleaner and potentially faster.*\\n\\n**Analysis:** This is actually a pretty good refactor, hitting several improvements: parallel fetching, grouping orders by user for efficiency, cleaner combination using .map and defaulting to an empty array. The AI also explained what it did. So why do we label this prompt as underspecified or “poor”? In this case, the AI happened to make good choices, but it *assumed* a lot because the prompt was open-ended. It assumed that performance should be improved (parallel requests, which is a smart change but what if parallel wasn’t safe here?), and it changed error handling to a generic message “Failed to fetch data,” which in combining the errors lost the specificity of which call failed.\\n\\nThe risk with a generic “Refactor this” prompt is that the AI might make changes that alter behavior in unintended ways. Here, combining error handling might be acceptable or not, depending on requirements. The assistant also made a structural change (using a dictionary to group orders) – that’s fine and probably for the better, but if we had specific constraints (like wanting to stream results or keep memory usage low), we didn’t inform it. So while the result looks good, it was somewhat lucky that the AI’s own interpretation of “refactor” aligned with what we wanted. This illustrates that an underspecified prompt can sometimes get good results on simple cases, but for complex code, it might go off in an undesired direction or miss certain improvements you care about.\\n\\n**✅ Prompt 2 (Goal-Oriented):** “Refactor the above getCombinedData function to eliminate duplicate code and improve performance. Specifically: (1) Avoid repeating the fetch logic for users and orders – maybe use a helper or fetch them together. (2) Fetch both lists in parallel if possible. (3) Keep the error handling for each fetch (we want to know which call failed). (4) Improve the combination of data, possibly by using a more efficient structure for lookup instead of a nested loop. Provide the refactored code with comments explaining the changes.”\\n\\n*AI’s response to Prompt 2:*\\n> *Sure! Here’s an improved version of getCombinedData with the requested refactoring:\\n\\n    async function getCombinedData(apiClient) {\\n      // 1. Fetch users and orders in parallel to improve performance\\n      const [usersResponse, ordersResponse] = await Promise.all([\\n        apiClient.fetch('/users'),\\n        apiClient.fetch('/orders')\\n      ]);\\n\\n      // 2. Handle errors separately to know which call failed\\n      if (!usersResponse.ok) {\\n        throw new Error('Failed to fetch users');\\n      }\\n      if (!ordersResponse.ok) {\\n        throw new Error('Failed to fetch orders');\\n      }\\n\\n      // Parse JSON responses in parallel\\n      const [users, orders] = await Promise.all([\\n        usersResponse.json(),\\n        ordersResponse.json()\\n      ]);\\n\\n      // 3. Use a lookup map for orders by userId for efficient matching\\n      const ordersByUser = orders.reduce((map, order) => {\\n        if (!map[order.userId]) {\\n          map[order.userId] = [];\\n        }\\n        map[order.userId].push(order);\\n        return map;\\n      }, {});\\n\\n      // 4. Combine data using the lookup map\\n      return users.map(user => ({\\n        user,\\n        orders: ordersByUser[user.id] || []  // empty array if no orders for user\\n      }));\\n    }\\n> **Explanation of changes:**\\n\\n- *Parallel fetching:* I used Promise.all to fetch users and orders at the same time (point 1).\\n\\n- *Preserved individual error handling:* I kept separate checks for usersResponse.ok and ordersResponse.ok so that any error clearly indicates which fetch failed (point 2).\\n\\n- *Parallel JSON parsing:* Also used Promise.all for response.json() calls, which is a minor improvement.\\n\\n- *Efficient combination:* Instead of a nested loop, I created an ordersByUser map (point 3). This groups orders by userId in a single pass. Then I map over users to build the result, pulling each user’s orders from the map in O(1) time (point 4). This is more efficient and concise.*\\n\\n**Analysis:** This response directly addressed all the specified goals. The code is refactored to be cleaner and faster, and it maintained separate error messages as requested. The AI’s explanation confirms each point we listed, which shows it carefully followed the prompt instructions. This is a great outcome because we, as the prompter, defined what “refactor” meant in this context. By doing so, we guided the AI to produce a solution that matches our needs with minimal back-and-forth. If the AI had overlooked one of the points (say it still merged the error handling), we could easily prompt again: *“Looks good, but please ensure the error messages remain distinct for users vs orders.”* – however, in this case it wasn’t needed because our prompt was thorough.\\n\\nThis example demonstrates a key lesson: **when you know what you want improved, spell it out.** AI is good at following instructions, but it won’t read your mind. A broad “make this better” might work for simple things, but for non-trivial code, you’ll get the best results by enumerating what “better” means to you. This aligns with community insights that clear, structured prompts yield significantly improved results .\\n\\n**Additional Refactoring Tips:**\\n\\n- *Refactor in steps:* If the code is very large or you have a long list of changes, you can tackle them one at a time. For example, first ask the AI to “refactor for readability” (focus on renaming, splitting functions), then later “optimize the algorithm in this function.” This prevents overwhelming the model with too many instructions at once and lets you verify each change stepwise.\\n\\n- *Ask for alternative approaches:* Maybe the AI’s first refactor works but you’re curious about a different angle. You can ask, *“Can you refactor it in another way, perhaps using functional programming style (e.g. array methods instead of loops)?”* or *“How about using recursion here instead of iterative approach, just to compare?”* This way, you can evaluate different solutions. It’s like brainstorming multiple refactoring options with a colleague.\\n\\n- *Combine refactoring with explanation to learn patterns:* We touched on this, but it’s worth emphasizing – use the AI as a learning tool. If it refactors code in a clever way, study the output and explanation. You might discover a new API or technique (like using reduce to build a map) that you hadn’t used before. This is one reason to ask for explanations: it turns an answer into a mini-tutorial, reinforcing your understanding of best practices.\\n\\n- *Validation and testing:* After any AI-generated refactor, always run your tests or try the code with sample inputs. AI might inadvertently introduce subtle bugs, especially if the prompt didn’t specify an important constraint. For example, in our refactor, if the original code intentionally separated fetch errors for logging but we didn’t mention logging, the combined error might be less useful. It’s our job to catch that in review. The AI can help by writing tests too – you could ask *“Generate a few unit tests for the refactored function”* to ensure it behaves the same as before on expected inputs.\\n\\nAt this point, we’ve covered debugging and refactoring – improving existing code. The next logical step is to use AI assistance for **implementing new features** or generating new code. We’ll explore how to prompt for that scenario effectively.\\n\\n**❌ Poor Prompt:** \\\"My useEffect isn't working right\\\"\\n\\n**✅ Enhanced Prompt:**\\n\\n    I have a React component that fetches user data, but it's causing infinite re-renders. Here's my code:\\n\\n\\n    const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {\\n      const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\\n      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\\n  \\n      useEffect(() => {\\n        fetchUser(userId).then(setUser).finally(() => setLoading(false));\\n      }, [userId, setUser, setLoading]); // Problem is here\\n  \\n      return loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <div>{user?.name}</div>;\\n    };\\n\\n**Expected behavior:** Should fetch user data once when userId changes Actual behavior: Component re-renders infinitely Error in console: \\\"Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded\\\"\\n\\nWhat's causing this infinite loop and how do I fix the dependency array?\\n\\n**Why this works:** Provides exact code, error message, expected vs actual behavior, and focuses on a specific React pattern that's commonly misunderstood.\\n\\n**❌ Poor Prompt:** \\\"Build the state management for my Next.js ecommerce app”\\n\\n✅ Enhanced Prompt:\\n\\nI'm building a Next.js 14 e-commerce app and need to design the state management architecture. Here are my requirements:\\n\\nComponents:\\n\\n- Product listing page (needs: products[], filters, pagination)\\n\\n- Shopping cart (needs: cart items, totals, shipping info)\\n\\n- User auth (needs: user profile, auth status, preferences)\\n\\n- Real-time notifications (needs: toast messages, error states)\\n\\nTechnical constraints:\\n\\n- Next.js 14 with App Router and Server Components\\n\\n- TypeScript strict mode\\n\\n- Server-side data fetching for SEO\\n\\n- Client-side interactivity for cart/user actions\\n\\n- State should persist across navigation\\n\\nShould I use:\\n\\n1. Zustand stores for each domain (cart, auth, notifications)\\n\\n2. React Query/TanStack Query for server state + Zustand for client state\\n\\n3. A single Zustand store with slices\\n\\nPlease provide a recommended architecture with code examples showing how to structure stores and integrate with Next.js App Router patterns.\\n\\n**Why this works:** Real-world scenario with specific tech stack, clear requirements, and asks for architectural guidance with implementation details.\\n\\nOne of the most exciting uses of AI code assistants is to help you write new code from scratch or integrate a new feature into an existing codebase. This could range from generating a boilerplate for a React component to writing a new API endpoint in an Express app. The challenge here is often that these tasks are open-ended – there are many ways to implement a feature. Prompt engineering for code generation is about guiding the AI to produce code that fits your needs and style. Here are strategies to do that:\\n\\n**1. Start with high-level instructions, then drill down.** Begin by outlining what you want to build in plain language, possibly breaking it into smaller tasks (similar to our advice on breaking down complex tasks earlier). For example, say you want to add a **search bar feature** to an existing web app. You might first prompt: *“Outline a plan to add a search feature that filters a list of products by name in my React app. The products are fetched from an API.”*\\n\\nThe AI might give you a step-by-step plan: “1. Add an input field for the search query. 2. Add state to hold the query. 3. Filter the products list based on the query. 4. Ensure it’s case-insensitive, etc.” Once you have this plan (which you can refine with the AI’s help), you can tackle each bullet with focused prompts.\\n\\nFor instance: *“Okay, implement step 1: create a SearchBar component with an input that updates a searchQuery state.”* After that, *“Implement step 3: given the searchQuery and an array of products, filter the products (case-insensitive match on name).”* By dividing the feature, you ensure each prompt is specific and the responses are manageable. This also mirrors iterative development – you can test each piece as it’s built.\\n\\n**2. Provide relevant context or reference code.** If you’re adding a feature to an existing project, it helps tremendously to show the AI how similar things are done in that project. For example, if you already have a component that is similar to what you want, you can say: *“Here is an existing UserList component (code…). Now create a ProductList component that is similar but includes a search bar.”*\\n\\nThe AI will see the patterns (maybe you use certain libraries or style conventions) and apply them. Having relevant files open or referencing them in your prompt provides context that leads to more project-specific and consistent code suggestions . Another trick: if your project uses a particular coding style or architecture (say Redux for state or a certain CSS framework), mention that. *“We use Redux for state management – integrate the search state into Redux store.”*\\n\\nA well-trained model will then generate code consistent with Redux patterns, etc. Essentially, you are **teaching the AI about your project’s environment** so it can tailor the output. Some assistants can even use your entire repository as context to draw from; if using those, ensure you point it to similar modules or documentation in your repo.\\n\\n- If starting something new but you have a preferred approach, you can also mention that: *“I’d like to implement this using functional programming style (no external state, using array methods).”* Or, *“Ensure to follow the MVC pattern and put logic in the controller, not the view.”* These are the kind of details a senior engineer might remind a junior about, and here **you are the senior telling the AI**.\\n\\n**3. Use comments and TODOs as inline prompts.** When working directly in an IDE with Copilot, one effective workflow is writing a comment that describes the next chunk of code you need, then letting the AI autocomplete it. For example, in a Node.js backend, you might write: // TODO: Validate the request payload (ensure name and email are provided) and then start the next line. Copilot often picks up on the intent and generates a block of code performing that validation. This works because your comment is effectively a natural language prompt. However, be prepared to edit the generated code if the AI misinterprets – as always, verify its correctness.\\n\\n**4. Provide examples of expected input/output or usage.** Similar to what we discussed before, if you’re asking the AI to implement a new function, include a quick example of how it will be used or a simple test case. For instance: *“Implement a function formatPrice(amount) in JavaScript that takes a number (like 2.5) and returns a string formatted in USD (like $2.50). For example, formatPrice(2.5) should return '$2.50'.”*\\n\\nBy giving that example, you constrain the AI to produce a function consistent with it. Without the example, the AI might assume some other formatting or currency. The difference could be subtle but important. Another example in a web context: *“Implement an Express middleware that logs requests. For instance, a GET request to /users should log ‘GET /users’ to the console.”* This makes it clear what the output should look like. Including expected behavior in the prompt acts as a test the AI will try to satisfy.\\n\\n**5. When the result isn’t what you want, rewrite the prompt with more detail or constraints.** It’s common that the first attempt at generating a new feature doesn’t nail it. Maybe the code runs but is not idiomatic, or it missed a requirement. Instead of getting frustrated, treat the AI like a junior dev who gave a first draft – now you need to give feedback. For example, *“The solution works but I’d prefer if you used the built-in array filter method instead of a for loop.”* Or, *“Can you refactor the generated component to use React Hooks for state instead of a class component? Our codebase is all functional components.”* You can also add new constraints: *“Also, ensure the function runs in O(n) time or better, because n could be large.”* This iterative prompting is powerful. A real-world scenario: one developer asked an LLM to generate code to draw an ice cream cone using a JS canvas library, but it kept giving irrelevant output until they refined the prompt with more specifics and context . The lesson is, *don’t give up after one try*. Figure out what was lacking or misunderstood in the prompt and clarify it. This is the essence of prompt engineering – each tweak can guide the model closer to what you envision.\\n\\nLet’s illustrate feature implementation prompting with an example scenario:\\n\\nSuppose we have a React application and we want to add a new component: a product list with a search filter and a sort dropdown. This is a fairly typical feature in a web app. We’ll focus on prompting for the search functionality within this component for brevity.\\n\\n**Initial Prompt (Feature request):** “Create a React functional component called ProductList that displays a list of products and includes a text input to filter the products by name. The component should: fetch an array of products from /api/products (assume it returns JSON array of {id, name, ...}), store them in state, and allow the user to type in a search box to filter the displayed products by name (case-insensitive match). Display the filtered list in a simple <ul> with product names. Include basic error handling (e.g. show an error message if the API call fails) and a loading state while fetching.”\\n\\nThat’s a long prompt but it’s specific. Let’s assume we give this to an LLM in a chat.\\n\\n*AI’s response (summary of what it might produce):* The AI would likely output a ProductList component something like:\\n\\n    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\\n\\n    function ProductList() {\\n      const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);\\n      const [search, setSearch] = useState('');\\n      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\\n      const [error, setError] = useState(null);\\n\\n      useEffect(() => {\\n        async function fetchProducts() {\\n          try {\\n            const res = await fetch('/api/products');\\n            if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\\n            const data = await res.json();\\n            setProducts(data);\\n          } catch (err) {\\n            console.error('Failed to fetch products:', err);\\n            setError('Failed to load products.');\\n          } finally {\\n            setLoading(false);\\n          }\\n        }\\n        fetchProducts();\\n      }, []);\\n\\n      const handleSearchChange = (e) => {\\n        setSearch(e.target.value);\\n      };\\n\\n      // Filter products by search query (case-insensitive)\\n      const filteredProducts = products.filter(product =>\\n        product.name.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase())\\n      );\\n\\n      if (loading) return <div>Loading products...</div>;\\n      if (error) return <div>{error}</div>;\\n\\n      return (\\n        <div className=\\\"product-list\\\">\\n          <input\\n            type=\\\"text\\\"\\n            placeholder=\\\"Search products\\\"\\n            value={search}\\n            onChange={handleSearchChange}\\n          />\\n          <ul>\\n            {filteredProducts.map(prod => (\\n              <li key={prod.id}>{prod.name}</li>\\n            ))}\\n          </ul>\\n        </div>\\n      );\\n    }\\n\\n    export default ProductList;\\n\\n*(Plus possibly some comments in the code explaining each part, if we asked for them.)*\\n\\nNow, let’s analyze this result and consider prompt refinements:\\n\\n- Suppose the above code came back, but our project uses a context or a global store for data fetching instead of fetching inside the component. This is something we didn’t specify. The AI made a choice to fetch in useEffect. If we prefer using a custom hook or context, we should have hinted at that. So we could refine our prompt: *“Actually, in our app we use a custom hook useProducts() that already handles fetching. Please refactor the component to use useProducts hook instead of directly calling fetch.”* The AI would then adjust, perhaps assuming useProducts returns { products, loading, error } and simplify the component accordingly.\\n\\n- Another refinement: maybe we realize we also want a sort dropdown (which we didn’t mention initially). We can now extend the conversation: *“Great, now add a dropdown to sort the products by name (A-Z or Z-A). The dropdown should let the user choose ascending or descending, and the list should sort accordingly in addition to the filtering.”* Because the AI has the context of the existing code, it can insert a sort state and adjust the rendering. We provided a clear new requirement, and it will attempt to fulfill it, likely by adding something like:\\n\\n    const [sortOrder, setSortOrder] = useState('asc');\\n    // ... a select input for sortOrder ...\\n    // and sort the filteredProducts before rendering:\\n    const sortedProducts = [...filteredProducts].sort((a, b) => {\\n      if (sortOrder === 'asc') return a.name.localeCompare(b.name);\\n      else return b.name.localeCompare(a.name);\\n    });\\n\\n- (plus the dropdown UI).\\n\\n  By iterating like this, feature by feature, we simulate a development cycle with the AI. This is far more effective than trying to prompt for the entire, complex component with all features in one go initially. It reduces mistakes and allows mid-course corrections as requirements become clearer.\\n\\n- If the AI makes a subtle mistake (say it forgot to make the search filter case-insensitive), we just point that out: *“Make the search case-insensitive.”* It will adjust the filter to use lowercase comparison (which in our pseudo-output it already did, but if not it would fix it).\\n\\nThis example shows that implementing features with AI is all about **incremental development and prompt refinement**. A Twitter thread might exclaim how someone built a small app by continually prompting an LLM for each part – that’s essentially the approach: build, review, refine, extend. Each prompt is like a commit in your development process.\\n\\n**Additional tips for feature implementation:**\\n\\n- *Let the AI scaffold, then you fill in specifics:* Sometimes it’s useful to have the AI generate a rough structure, then you tweak it. For example, *“Generate the skeleton of a Node.js Express route for user registration with validation and error handling.”* It might produce a generic route with placeholders. You can then fill in the actual validation rules or database calls which are specific to your app. The AI saves you from writing boilerplate, and you handle the custom logic if it’s sensitive.\\n\\n- *Ask for edge case handling:* When generating a feature, you might prompt the AI to think of edge cases: *“What edge cases should we consider for this feature (and can you handle them in the code)?”* For instance, in the search example, an edge case might be “what if the products haven’t loaded yet when the user types?” (though our code handles that via loading state) or “what if two products have the same name” (not a big issue but maybe mention it). The AI could mention things like empty result handling, very large lists (maybe needing debounce for search input), etc. This is a way to leverage the AI’s training on common pitfalls.\\n\\n- *Documentation-driven development:* A nifty approach some have taken is writing a docstring or usage example first and having the AI implement the function to match. For example:\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Returns the nth Fibonacci number.\\n     * @param {number} n - The position in Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed).\\n     * @returns {number} The nth Fibonacci number.\\n     *\\n     * Example: fibonacci(5) -> 5  (sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,…)\\n     */\\n    function fibonacci(n) {\\n      // ... implementation\\n    }\\n\\n- If you write the above comment and function signature, an LLM might fill in the implementation correctly because the comment describes exactly what to do and even gives an example. This technique ensures you clarify the feature in words first (which is a good practice generally), and then the AI uses that as the spec to write the code.\\n\\nHaving covered prompting strategies for debugging, refactoring, and new code generation, let’s turn our attention to some **common pitfalls and anti-patterns** in prompt engineering for coding. Understanding these will help you avoid wasting time on unproductive interactions and quickly adjust when the AI isn’t giving you what you need.\\n\\nNot all prompts are created equal. By now, we’ve seen numerous examples of effective prompts, but it’s equally instructive to recognize **anti-patterns** – common mistakes that lead to poor AI responses.\\n\\n[https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J-ik!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0116373b-99df-416b-9bd0-6840d33fcdd2_1024x1077.png](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J-ik!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0116373b-99df-416b-9bd0-6840d33fcdd2_1024x1077.png)\\n\\nHere are some frequent prompt failures and how to fix them:\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: The Vague Prompt.** This is the classic *“It doesn’t work, please fix it”* or *“Write something that does X”* without enough detail. We saw an example of this when the question “Why isn’t my function working?” got a useless answer . Vague prompts force the AI to guess the context and often result in generic advice or irrelevant code. The fix is straightforward: **add context and specifics**. If you find yourself asking a question and the answer feels like a Magic 8-ball response (“Have you tried checking X?”), stop and reframe your query with more details (error messages, code excerpt, expected vs actual outcome, etc.). A good practice is to read your prompt and ask, *“Could this question apply to dozens of different scenarios?”* If yes, it’s too vague. Make it so specific that it could *only* apply to your scenario.\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: The Overloaded Prompt.** This is the opposite issue: asking the AI to do too many things at once. For instance, *“Generate a complete Node.js app with authentication, a front-end in React, and deployment scripts.”* Or even on a smaller scale, *“Fix these 5 bugs and also add these 3 features in one go.”* The AI might attempt it, but you’ll likely get a jumbled or incomplete result, or it might ignore some parts of the request. Even if it addresses everything, the response will be long and harder to verify. The remedy is to **split the tasks**. Prioritize: do one thing at a time, as we emphasized earlier. This makes it easier to catch mistakes and ensures the model stays focused. If you catch yourself writing a paragraph with multiple “and” in the instructions, consider breaking it into separate prompts or sequential steps.\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: Missing the Question.** Sometimes users will present a lot of information but never clearly ask a question or specify what they need. For example, dumping a large code snippet and just saying “Here’s my code.” This can confuse the AI – it doesn’t know what you want. Always include a clear ask, such as *“Identify any bugs in the above code”*, *“Explain what this code does”*, or *“Complete the TODOs in the code”*. A prompt should have a *purpose*. If you just provide text without a question or instruction, the AI might make incorrect assumptions (like summarizing the code instead of fixing it, etc.). Make sure the AI knows *why* you showed it some code. Even a simple addition like, *“What’s wrong with this code?”* or *“Please continue implementing this function.”* gives it direction.\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: Vague Success Criteria.** This is a subtle one – sometimes you might ask for an optimization or improvement, but you don’t define what success looks like. For example, *“Make this function faster.”* Faster by what metric? If the AI doesn’t know your performance constraints, it might micro-optimize something that doesn’t matter or use an approach that’s theoretically faster but practically negligible. Or *“make this code cleaner”* – “cleaner” is subjective. We dealt with this by explicitly stating goals like “reduce duplication” or “improve variable names” etc. The fix: **quantify or qualify the improvement**. E.g., “optimize this function to run in linear time (current version is quadratic)” or “refactor this to remove global variables and use a class instead.” Basically, *be explicit about what problem you’re solving with the refactor or feature*. If you leave it too open, the AI might solve a different problem than the one you care about.\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: Ignoring AI’s Clarification or Output.** Sometimes the AI might respond with a clarifying question or an assumption. For instance: *“Are you using React class components or functional components?”* or *“I assume the input is a string – please confirm.”* If you ignore these and just reiterate your request, you’re missing an opportunity to improve the prompt. The AI is signaling that it needs more info. Always answer its questions or refine your prompt to include those details. Additionally, if the AI’s output is clearly off (like it misunderstood the question), *don’t just retry the same prompt verbatim*. Take a moment to adjust your wording. Maybe your prompt had an ambiguous phrase or omitted something essential. Treat it like a conversation – if a human misunderstood, you’d explain differently; do the same for the AI.\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: Varying Style or Inconsistency.** If you keep changing how you ask or mixing different formats in one go, the model can get confused. For example, switching between first-person and third-person in instructions, or mixing pseudocode with actual code in a confusing way. Try to maintain a consistent style within a single prompt. If you provide examples, ensure they are clearly delineated (use Markdown triple backticks for code, quotes for input/output examples, etc.). Consistency helps the model parse your intent correctly. Also, if you have a preferred style (say, ES6 vs ES5 syntax), consistently mention it, otherwise the model might suggest one way in one prompt and another way later.\\n\\n- **Anti-Pattern: Vague references like “above code”.** When using chat, if you say “the above function” or “the previous output”, be sure the reference is clear. If the conversation is long and you say “refactor the above code”, the AI might lose track or pick the wrong code snippet to refactor. It’s safer to either quote the code again or specifically name the function you want refactored. Models have a limited attention window, and although many LLMs can refer to prior parts of the conversation, giving it explicit context again can help avoid confusion. This is especially true if some time (or several messages) passed since the code was shown.\\n\\nFinally, here’s a **tactical approach to rewriting prompts** when things go wrong:\\n\\n- **Identify what was missing or incorrect in the AI’s response.** Did it solve a different problem? Did it produce an error or a solution that doesn’t fit? For example, maybe you asked for a solution in TypeScript but it gave plain JavaScript. Or it wrote a recursive solution when you explicitly wanted iterative. Pinpoint the discrepancy.\\n\\n- **Add or emphasize that requirement in a new prompt.** You might say, *“The solution should be in TypeScript, not JavaScript. Please include type annotations.”* Or, *“I mentioned I wanted an iterative solution – please avoid recursion and use a loop instead.”* Sometimes it helps to literally use phrases like *“Note:”* or *“Important:”* in your prompt to highlight key constraints (the model doesn’t have emotions, but it does weigh certain phrasing as indicating importance). For instance: *“**Important:** Do not use any external libraries for this.”* or *“**Note:** The code must run in the browser, so no Node-specific APIs.”*.\\n\\n- **Break down the request further if needed.** If the AI repeatedly fails on a complex request, try asking for a smaller piece first. Or ask a question that might enlighten the situation: *“Do you understand what I mean by X?”* The model might then paraphrase what it thinks you mean, and you can correct it if it’s wrong. This is meta-prompting – discussing the prompt itself – and can sometimes resolve misunderstandings.\\n\\n- **Consider starting fresh if the thread is stuck.** Sometimes after multiple tries, the conversation may reach a confused state. It can help to start a new session (or clear the chat history for a moment) and prompt from scratch with a more refined ask that you’ve formulated based on previous failures. The model doesn’t mind repetition, and a fresh context can eliminate any accumulated confusion from prior messages.\\n\\nBy being aware of these anti-patterns and their solutions, you’ll become much faster at adjusting your prompts on the fly. Prompt engineering for developers is very much an iterative, feedback-driven process (as any programming task is!). The good news is, you now have a lot of patterns and examples in your toolkit to draw from.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is a bit of an art and a bit of a science – and as we’ve seen, it’s quickly becoming a must-have skill for developers working with AI code assistants. By crafting clear, context-rich prompts, you essentially *teach* the AI what you need, just as you would onboard a human team member or explain a problem to a peer. Throughout this article, we explored how to systematically approach prompts for debugging, refactoring, and feature implementation:\\n\\n- We learned to feed the AI the same information you’d give a colleague when asking for help: what the code is supposed to do, how it’s misbehaving, relevant code snippets, and so on – thereby getting much more targeted help .\\n\\n- We saw the power of iterating with the AI, whether it’s stepping through a function’s logic line by line, or refining a solution through multiple prompts (like turning a recursive solution into an iterative one, then improving variable names) . Patience and iteration turn the AI into a true pair programmer rather than a one-shot code generator.\\n\\n- We utilized role-playing and personas to up-level the responses – treating the AI as a code reviewer, a mentor, or an expert in a certain stack . This often produces more rigorous and explanation-rich outputs, which not only solve the problem but educate us in the process.\\n\\n- For refactoring and optimization, we emphasized defining what “good” looks like (be it faster, cleaner, more idiomatic, etc.) , and the AI showed that it can apply known best practices when guided (like parallelizing calls, removing duplication, handling errors properly). It’s like having access to the collective wisdom of countless code reviewers – but you have to ask the right questions to tap into it.\\n\\n- We also demonstrated building new features step by step with AI assistance, showing that even complex tasks can be decomposed and tackled one prompt at a time. The AI can scaffold boilerplate, suggest implementations, and even highlight edge cases if prompted – acting as a knowledgeable co-developer who’s always available.\\n\\n- Along the way, we identified pitfalls to avoid: keeping prompts neither too vague nor too overloaded, always specifying our intent and constraints, and being ready to adjust when the AI’s output isn’t on target. We cited concrete examples of bad prompts and saw how minor changes (like including an error message or expected output) can dramatically improve the outcome.\\n\\nAs you incorporate these techniques into your workflow, you’ll likely find that working with AI becomes more intuitive. You’ll develop a feel for what phrasing gets the best results and how to guide the model when it goes off course. Remember that the AI is a product of its training data – it has seen many examples of code and problem-solving, but it’s *you* who provides direction on which of those examples are relevant now. In essence, **you set the context, and the AI follows through**.\\n\\n**It’s also worth noting that prompt engineering is an evolving practice.** The community of developers is constantly discovering new tricks – a clever one-liner prompt or a structured template can suddenly go viral on social media because it unlocks a capability people didn’t realize was there. Stay tuned to those discussions (on Hacker News, Twitter, etc.) because they can inspire your own techniques. But also, don’t be afraid to experiment yourself. Treat the AI as a flexible tool – if you have an idea (“what if I ask it to draw an ASCII diagram of my architecture?”), just try it. You might be surprised at the results, and if it fails, no harm done – you’ve learned something about the model’s limits or needs.\\n\\n**In summary, prompt engineering empowers developers to get more out of AI assistants.** It’s the difference between a frustrating experience (“this tool is useless, it gave me nonsense”) and a productive one (“this feels like pair programming with an expert who writes boilerplate for me”). By applying the playbook of strategies we’ve covered – from providing exhaustive context to nudging the AI’s style and thinking – you can turn these code-focused AI tools into true extensions of your development workflow. The end result is not only that you code faster, but often you pick up new insights and patterns along the way (as the AI explains things or suggests alternatives), leveling up your own skillset.\\n\\nAs a final takeaway, remember that **prompting is an iterative dialogue**. Approach it with the same clarity, patience, and thoroughness you’d use when communicating with another engineer. Do that, and you’ll find that AI assistants can significantly amplify your abilities – helping you debug quicker, refactor smarter, and implement features with greater ease.\\n\\n**Happy prompting, and happy coding!**\\n\\n**Further reading:**\\n\\n- *[How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=3%20best%20practices%20for%20prompt,crafting%20with%20GitHub%20Copilot)*[.

According to our [2024 State of Software Quality survey](https://www.codacy.com/resources/state-of-software-quality-report), 64% of developers have already integrated AI into their code production workflows, and 62% use AI to review their code.\\n\\nMore than half (58%) of the developers surveyed said they use [AI coding assistants](/ai-tools-for-developers) to help them write code, with 46% of front-end developers stating that AI tools help them with 30% or more of their work.\\n\\nEven the 51% of programmers who said they have never used AI coding tools plan on trying them soon. More than a third (36%) of these late adopters say that the biggest blocker for them is learning how to use these tools effectively.\\n\\n## How AI Coding Tools Help Developers\\n\\nThe primary benefit of [AI-assisted coding](/webinar-recap-ai-assisted-development) is increased productivity. [Stack Overflow’s 2023 developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#ai) found that a third of polled developers believe increased productivity is the most impactful benefit of introducing AI assistants into their workflow.\\n\\n“I'm a big fan of the idea that code should be generated, not crafted. ChatGPT nails the first draft for me, and then it's my turn to bring in the handcrafted polish,” said Jasiek Gajdowicz, Senior Developer at [Survicate](https://survicate.com/).\\n\\nAI tools excel in rapid prototyping, meaning they can almost instantly generate functional code, allowing developers to easily create a starting point that helps them explore various permutations and combinations.\\n\\nAnother productivity benefit of AI coding tools is the speed at which they can create documentation for your code. Developers can give an AI coding assistant a function and ask the tool to generate documentation and comments for the function and receive a draft in seconds.\\n\\nDevelopers have always used resources like Stack Overflow to research and find solutions. AI tools make this process even easier, acting as a rapid and focused search engine that allows you to quickly find the algorithm you need and generate code using it. AI tools also enable you to find and add a single algorithm instead of adding an extensive library to your application, potentially bloating your codebase.\\n\\nBut as with any new technology, [potential pitfalls of using AI to code](/ai-assisted-coding-7-pros-and-cons-to-consider) do exist. Overdependence on AI and the potential for introducing inaccuracies and security issues into your codebase are common concerns for companies hesitant to integrate AI coding tools.\\n\\nTo get the most out of AI coding assistants, teams must understand these tradeoffs and implement best practices that amplify the benefits of AI while safeguarding their applications and minimizing the potential issues and drawbacks.\\n\\n## Best Practices for Leveraging AI Coding Tools\\n\\nWhile speed and efficiency are priorities for development teams today, nothing should trump code quality. Interestingly enough, 77% of developers [surveyed by Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/the-state-of-ai-tools-and-coding-2023-edition/) believe that AI coding tools will positively impact the quality of code they ship. AI coding tools don’t just help you write code; there are [AI coding solutions that help you review your code](https://ai.codacy.com/) and give suggestions on how to improve it.\\n\\nThe first step to [getting the most out of coding with AI](/webinar-recap-ai-assisted-development) is recognizing the benefits and risks involved. The next step is understanding how to responsibly integrate AI-generated code into your application by following AI coding best practices.\\n\\n### Encapsulate AI-Generate Code\\n\\nEncapsulate AI-generated code into defined modules or functions to improve readability and usability immediately. Code encapsulation means wrapping a piece of code, typically a set of statements or functions, within a higher-level structure such as a function, class, or module. The encapsulated code is then treated as a single unit with a well-defined interface and can be invoked or interacted with as a cohesive entity.\\n\\nEncapsulation promotes modular design by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable units. Each encapsulated unit can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, making the codebase more modular and easier to understand.\\n\\nEncapsulated units can also be reused in different parts of a program or other projects.\\n\\n### Document AI Usage Thoroughly\\n\\nProper documentation is vital for any well-maintained coding project, but it’s imperative when introducing AI-generated code into your work.\\n\\nDocumenting the AI-generated code helps make the project more transparent. It allows team members, stakeholders, and future developers to understand how AI models are utilized within the codebase.\\n\\nIt also ensures that the process of generating AI models can be replicated. Future developers or researchers may need to reproduce the AI models for validation, improvement, or adaptation to new data, and thorough documentation simplifies this process.\\n\\nAs projects evolve, code may need to be updated or modified. Documentation aids in the maintenance process by providing insights into the original design and implementation of the AI models. When issues or bugs arise, well-documented code allows developers to troubleshoot more efficiently. It serves as a reference for understanding the intended functionality and identifying potential areas for improvement.\\n\\nDocumentation is also valuable for knowledge transfer between team members. It helps in passing on expertise and insights about the AI components, reducing the risk of knowledge silos within the team.\\n\\nUse documentation tools and methods like JSDocs or Python Docstrings to clearly explain the purpose of your AI-created code, its parameters, returns, exceptions, and even its perceived limitations.\\n\\n### Familiarize AI Tools with Your Coding Standards\\n\\nProvide the AI coding assistant with information about your coding standards, style preferences, and project-specific guidelines to help tailor the generated code to match your team's established best practices.\\n\\nWhile it’s tempting to jump right in and immediately ask the large language model (LMM) to generate a function that does this or that, equipping the AI assistant with knowledge of the rules and [coding standards](/coding-standards) you want it to follow first will yield better code that requires less rework down the line.\\n\\n### Create Specific and Detailed Prompts\\n\\nCraft prompts that are specific and contextual. Clearly articulate your requirements, including specific libraries, frameworks, or constraints.\\n\\nThis helps the AI understand and generate code that aligns closely with your needs. As an example, check out this [AI coding experiment](/we-analyzed-ai-generated-code) performed by Codacy CEO Jaime Jorge to see how vital the prompt is to the outcome.\\n\\nAI coding tools don’t have the human intuition and context needed to understand what you want to achieve unless you provide detailed instructions.\\n\\n### Review and Test AI-Generated Code Thoroughly\\n\\nAvoid mindlessly copying and pasting AI-generated code without understanding its functionality. Take the time to comprehend the logic and adapt it to your project's needs. This ensures that the code integrates seamlessly and meets your specific requirements.\\n\\nAdjustments may be necessary to meet coding standards, performance considerations, or project-specific nuances. Use [static code analysis](/static-code-analysis) to catch potential code errors and issues that aren’t obvious. To enforce [code quality](/code-quality-explained) standards, require [code reviews](/code-reviews-best-practices) and approval of all auto-generated code before acceptance.\\n\\nBe mindful of [code coverage](/what-is-code-coverage) to ensure your test suite always covers newly created code so that it doesn't slip through the cracks and into a release without thorough testing.\\n\\n### Validate AI Coding with Human Expertise\\n\\nAI is a powerful tool, however, human intuition and experience are essential for ensuring the quality and appropriateness of the generated code. AI can offer valuable suggestions and insights but should complement, not replace, human expertise. While AI can aid in decision-making, complex or high-stakes decisions require human judgment.\\n\\nDevelopers should always cross-reference AI-generated code with established solutions and industry best practices and validate the logic and efficiency of the code based on company coding standards and personal know-how.\\n\\nBy conscientiously validating and thoughtfully integrating AI-generated code, you can capitalize on the speed and insights offered by AI while upholding the stringent standards necessary for successful embedded software development.\\n\\n### Create an Iterative Process\\n\\nConsider the previously mentioned best practices to refine and improve the code generated by the AI iteratively. This involves creating an ongoing process of generating, reviewing, and refining code and repeating the process until the desired outcome is achieved.\\n\\nAn iterative process for using AI coding tools could look something like this:\\n\\n- Input your coding standards and style preferences\\n- Break down your task into smaller, logical steps\\n- Create a thorough and specific prompt\\n- Review and analyze the generated code\\n\\n\\nIf you’re not satisfied with the results, go back and refine these steps. Once you start receiving code you’re happier with, develop a further iterative process to make the code even better:\\n\\n- Perform code reviews both manually and using automated [static code analysis tools](/static-code-analysis-tools)\\n- Test the code\\n- Make manual, “hand-coded” refinements\\n\\n\\nIterative processes for validating AI-generated code quality are essential if your team wants to build [a development culture that prioritizes code quality](/quality-oriented-culture) above all else.\\n\\n## Security Best Practices for Integrating AI-Generated Code Into Your Codebase\\n\\n[Security issues associated with AI coding](/is-coding-with-ai-secure) are top of mind for all companies interested in integrating these tools into their development workflow. [A recent research study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622) showed that developers using AI coding tools wrote less secure code. More worryingly, they were more convinced that their code was, in fact, secure than developers who didn't use AI tools.\\n\\nShipping reliable and secure applications should be prioritized over speed and productivity. We’ve recently seen security prioritization in software development take center stage, with more focus on establishing [DevSecOps](/what-is-devsecops) teams and processes, encouraging [shift left testing](/shift-left-testing), and following security frameworks like the [Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10](/owasp-top-10).\\n\\nAI coding is new territory for everyone. That’s why security best practices are essential when integrating AI-generated code into your application and providing LLMs access to your company code.\\n\\n### Restrict Access to Private and Sensitive Data\\n\\nOne of the best features of AI tools is that they are trainable systems. Developers often feed AI code samples from their projects to guide them. Training the LLM helps AI analyze your code and even help you refactor it if necessary.\\n\\nWhen giving AI tools access, ensure you’re not allowing them to access restricted data in the process. If you haven’t already, create company-wide policies prohibiting giving AI tools access to intellectual property and other sensitive data.\\n\\nChatGPT creators OpenAI are very aware of these concerns and have addressed them in [ChatGPT Enterprise](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise), their LLM that does not use your data or prompts as training data.\\n\\nRegardless of the fail-safes that AI tools install, your team should also establish what checks need to be done both before and after an LLM interacts with your code in any way.\\n\\n### Understand the Risk of Prompt Injections\\n\\nAnother security concern related to AI coding is that developers can’t be sure that the AI tool is secure and hasn’t been compromised at any point. One possible problem security teams need to be aware of is direct and indirect prompt injections.\\n\\nAI tools are attractive targets for cybercriminals because of their growing popularity. Prompt injections would enable attackers to inject malicious input into the LLM, which the AI tool can then pass to other systems.\\n\\nDirect and indirect prompt injections administer specific instructions or queries into a language model to influence output. These techniques are often used in fine-tuning or customizing a language model's behavior for a specific task or application.\\n\\nFor example, prompt injections could manipulate AI tools into recommending insecure coding solutions to developers, which, if implemented, could compromise application security.\\n\\n### Practice Proper Secrets Management\\n\\nIn software development, the term \\\"secrets\\\" pertains to sensitive credentials of a non-human nature. Secrets are the digital keys used for authentication and giving access to software data and systems.\\n\\nSoftware applications today have transcended standalone entities and depend on an intricate network of third-party databases, cloud infrastructure, and various software components. These components are intricately interlinked and securely established through the utilization of secrets.\\n\\n[Implementing secrets management](/secrets-management) represents a fundamental cybersecurity practice for digital security teams. Defining this process ensures that access to secrets is restricted solely to individuals with proper authorization and authentication.\\n\\nTo ensure that your developers can’t accidentally or unknowingly offer up secrets within their AI-created code, it’s important to store secrets securely and encrypt them so that if they are revealed or stolen somehow, they still can’t be deciphered.\\n\\nTake advantage of automated code analysis tools with [secrets detection](https://blog.codacy.com/new-security-and-risk-management-features#SecretDetection) capabilities and other security features.\\n\\n### Review Suggested Third-Party Dependencies\\n\\nIncorporating third-party dependencies like external libraries, frameworks, or modules is a widespread practice that can save developers time, provide additional functionality, and improve overall efficiency.\\n\\nAI tools often recommend third-party libraries or frameworks if the tool believes that these dependencies could enhance your project. No matter who (or what) is giving these types of recommendations, you should review them thoroughly before incorporation.\\n\\nDon’t implement third-party dependencies blindly. Research them first to see if they are coming from a trusted source. When reviewing dependencies, you’ll want to know if they are coming from a credible and large community, if they are actively maintained, and whether known security vulnerabilities exist.\\n\\nIt’s also a good idea to have an automated tool that scans and [detects insecure dependencies](/insecure-dependencies-detection) in your application. If you do incorporate a dependency, be sure to test it in a controlled environment before deployment.\\n\\n### Be Wary of Hallucinations\\n\\nAI models can occasionally produce inaccuracies or be led astray by erroneous data. These so-called “hallucinations” refer to instances where the AI generates entirely fictional or incorrect information. Similarly, misleading data may manifest as plausible outputs but are ultimately inaccurate or biased.\\n\\nLLMs cannot discern when they are wrong or engaging in hallucinatory behavior. Unlike humans, who can make assumptions and perform tasks guided by limited facts, LLMs generate responses solely from learned patterns and information in their training data. They operate without consciousness or self-awareness and cannot assess the accuracy or correctness of their outputs and the data they learn from.\\n\\nAn excellent example of AI tools producing hallucinations and vulnerable third-party dependencies can be seen in this [study performed by security company Vulcan](https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk?). The study identified an attack technique in which ChatGPT offered links to nonexistent coding libraries and generated questionable code snippets as fixes to common vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals could then hijack these fake libraries by publishing a malicious package in place of the library and hoping developers would install the infected library based on the AI tool’s recommendation.\\n\\n## Automated Code Review Tools Make Coding with AI Easier and Safer\\n\\nAI coding tools are great helpers that aid developers in brainstorming and create code faster than ever before. However, developers need to treat AI-generated code like any other code. They must thoroughly test and review it before deploying it.\\n\\nCodacy is a perfect platform for development teams that want to take advantage of the benefits of AI coding tools while avoiding potential pitfalls. Codacy automatically scans all your human and machine-generated code, identifying code quality and security issues as you work.\\n\\nTo test it out, [sign up for a free 14-day trial today](https://www.codacy.com/signup-codacy).\\n\\n========================\\n## post by RandomInsano on Nov 20, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n[![](https://sea1.discourse-cdn.com/flex019/user_avatar/users.rust-lang.org/randominsano/48/3556_2.png)](/u/randominsano)\\n\\nI've been using Visual Studio Code with the Rust Analyzer for years now and it's nearly flawless except for maintaining example code within rustdoc snippets.

I think maybe this is worth an RFC... I like the idea of spending a little extra time on my unit tests so they're readable and well documented for newbies, then referencing them from the rustdoc block. Having those tests defined in individual code.rs files isn't the canonical way of writing unit tests so that would feel weird for both creators and consumers of public APIs.\\n\\nScraped examples is neat but looking at winit examples (I actually use this crate in a project) they're not friendly to read...

For an example of this in practice, consider the examples in:\\n\\n- [Option::as_slice](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.as_slice), which gives a second example set off with some leading explanatory text;\\n- [Option::as_mut_slice](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.as_mut_slice), which goes further in explaining its examples;\\n- [Axum's \\\"Examples\\\" section](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/#example), which places a large example as its own section in the middle of a longer crate-level document;\\n\\n\\nand numerous others.\\n\\nDocumentation, taken as a whole, is written to be read; doctests are there to ensure that the documentation is correct and that the examples will actually work if followed, as well as to act as tests for the code being documented.\\n\\nAs Rust stands today, a `#[doc(example…)]` attribute does not obviously allow these authorial choices, as there is no clear way to position the example within the larger flow of the documentation.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, I love the bones of the idea, and I do think it'd be useful to have some way to take larger examples out of code blocks inside `///` comments, for ergonomics reasons if no other, so I hope you do keep working on this.\\n\\n## post by kpreid on Nov 27, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n[![](https://sea1.discourse-cdn.com/flex019/user_avatar/users.rust-lang.org/kpreid/48/22420_2.png)](/u/kpreid)\\n\\nFWIW, Rust documentation isn’t really “comments”, or rather, it doesn’t have the traditional problems with comments being outside of the normal AST; the source code\\n\\n    ///foo\\n\\nis completely equivalent to\\n\\n    #[doc = \\\"foo\\\"]\\n\\nand lives in the attributes section of the AST; there is no need to track them specially to preserve them like regular comments. It’s still true that code in documentation (doc-tests) is more troublesome to manpulate, but that’s because:\\n\\n- the code sections are notated in Markdown, and that Markdown isn’t part of the normal Rust AST (but rust-analyzer already knows how to parse these for syntax highlighting at least), and\\n- doc-tests are compiled as separate crates from the library they are for, and Cargo doesn’t do that (instead, rustdoc does while running tests) so there isn’t an easy way to compile them and extract metadata from them like there is for normal Cargo-managed code.\\n\\n## post by nerditation on Nov 28, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n[![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/n/e79b87/48.png)](/u/nerditation)\\n\\nfirst of all, `doc` is an attribute, not a macro.\\n\\neach line of comment is equivalent to a `#[doc = \\\"blahblah\\\"]` attribute in the parsed AST. however, this attribute is preserved but not used by `rustc` (the compiler), but is processed by `rustdoc`.\\n\\nand yes, I agree, to extend the current `doc` attribute is probably the most viable path to go. currently, the valid attributes that I know of include `#[doc(hidden)]`, `#[doc(inline)]`, `#[doc(alias = \\\"foobar\\\")]`, and some unstable ones like `#[doc(cfg(xxx))]`. it feels natural to me to add more features here.\\n\\nin fact, the compile diagnostics you see when you compile source code with the \\\"extended\\\" attribute is not generated by the compiler itself, but by a [builtin lint](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#invalid-doc-attributes).\\n\\nso, if you disable the lint, code like below *can* actually compile, on the current compiler. it's just the \\\"extension\\\" isn't understood by `rustdoc` so it is completely ignored:\\n\\n    // src/lib\\n    #![allow(invalid_doc_attributes)]\\n    #[doc(example(tests::bar))]\\n    pub fn foo() {}\\n\\n    $ cargo build\\n       Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/tmp/hello)\\n        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.07s\\n    $ cargo doc\\n     Documenting hello v0.1.0 (/tmp/hello)\\n        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.18s\\n       Generated /tmp/hello/target/doc/hello/index.html\\n\\nif you want to play with the idea of extending the `doc` attribute, here's what I think you need to do:\\n\\n- first modify the `invalid_doc_attributes` lint to accept the new syntax;\\n- then add a `rustdoc` *pass* to consume the attribute;\\n  - e.g. to get started, just insert the source code of the specified tests as code blocks into the docs;\\n  - presumably also add the `no_run` or `ignore` attributes, since it's already tested as unit tests.\\n\\n\\nunfortunately I'm not a compiler hacker, I cannot give more detailed instructions, but [the tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82730) for `invalid_doc_attributes` and [the exising passes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/66adeaf46b7a646daeed29518ef76235fcdb9726/src/librustdoc/passes/mod.rs) of `rustdoc` can be a good starting point.\\n\\n## post by Lej77 on Nov 28, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n[![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/e5b9ba/48.png)](/u/lej77)\\n\\nSince doc attributes can use other macros to get their string content it is possible to mostly implement this feature in a library:\\n\\n    // Make \\\"playground\\\" available as an \\\"external\\\" crate name to easier write doctests\\n    extern crate self as playground;\\n\\n    /// StaticFunction implodes the universe into a conveniently sized travel lozenge\\n    ///\\n    /// ```\\n    #[doc = test_static_function!()]\\n    /// ```\\n    pub fn StaticFunction() {\\n        todo!()\\n    }\\n\\n    // #[my_custom_attribute_macro] // <- user would add this\\n    fn test_static_function() {\\n        // Don't use super::StaticFunction or crate::StaticFunction here since that would fail in the doc test.\\n        use playground::StaticFunction;\\n        StaticFunction();\\n    }\\n\\n    // #[my_custom_attribute_macro] would expand to:\\n    macro_rules!

A simple line of instructions can change the entire design of a feature.\\n\\nHow can prompts drive predictable code generation without creating confusion?\\n\\nThis blog explores how clear direction drives reliable outcomes and how better communication helps AI better understand real expectations.\\n\\n## The Shift Toward Intent-Driven Development\\n\\nClear intent gives structure to every AI supported workflow.\\n\\nTeams often use prompt engineering methods without considering how they guide the system. Many coding prompts lack direction and fall into vague prompts that hide real goals. Every time instructions lose precision, systems guess and create unexpected output. These moments usually slow work instead of helping it.\\n\\nBetter prompts reshape how teams write code. They also show how logic should flow across a programming language. Many groups stay stuck at the surface level, prompting instead of treating it like a design task. Work becomes smoother when prompts describe flow, interaction, and testing needs.\\n\\n## Writing With Intention\\n\\nClear direction inside prompts strengthens every part of a developer's workflow.\\n\\nMany teams learned this through real projects. Another lesson appears when developers add details about expected output. Small changes in phrasing guide AI systems when they generate code. Teams that describe specific structure patterns get cleaner results.\\n\\nBelow are patterns that help systems produce consistent and structured code generation:\\n\\n- **Direct goal:** description of the feature purpose\\n- **Exact inputs:** description of values, types, and rules\\n- **Expected steps:** description of execution order\\n- **Edge case notes:** description of special conditions\\n- **Short test plan:** description of what unit tests must confirm\\n\\n\\nThese patterns break ambiguity and improve stability. Development teams also reduce redundant code when prompts give shape to the logic. Every detail supports the reasoning process inside the model.\\n\\n## Where Problems Usually Begin?\\n\\nProjects lose clarity when prompts change often without structure.\\n\\nConfusion also grows when the coding prompts skip context. Many developers ask systems to generate code, but overlook how prompts must fit the larger system. Models can produce complete blocks, yet they cannot guess expectations without direction.\\n\\nSeveral common mistakes appear across teams:\\n\\n- **Missing context:** description forgotten from the prompt\\n- **Loose conditions:** description expressed without detail\\n- **Conflicting instructions:** description pulling in two directions\\n- **Flat requests:** description giving no structure to the logic\\n\\n\\nThese issues lead to performance issues during testing and slow down code debugging. Careful pattern design fixes these gaps early and helps teams avoid hidden security vulnerabilities.\\n\\n## Comparison on Prompt Quality\\n\\nThe table highlights how small changes improve clarity when writing code with AI support.\\n\\n| Prompt type | Strength | Weakness | Testing impact |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| High detail | Strong structure | Requires time | Faster test cycles |\\n| Medium detail | Balanced | Some missing data | Extra tests needed |\\n| Low detail | Quick | Many gaps | High test load |\\n\\nAttention to detail creates better prompts. Teams that understand this pattern produce more stable code and encounter fewer issues during review.\\n\\n### Example On Structure\\n\\nA controlled prompt can guide a system to generate code that stays close to the project’s goals.\\n\\nA small example helps show the value:\\n\\n- **Prompt structure:** description of logic, data flow, and expected output\\n- **Clear naming:** description of variable and function naming rules\\n- **Testing notes:** description of cases required in the testing framework\\n\\n\\nThis pattern affects every programming language. Simple details, such as naming or comments, also help reduce confusion during code review.\\n\\n### System Flow Diagram\\n\\nThe flow diagram below shows how prompts flow through an AI model to produce functional output.\\n\\n![SVG

diagram shows how instructions affect each stage. Each phase shapes the structure of generated code. The clearer the instructions, the safer the outcome.\\n\\n## How Code Shapes Itself Through Prompts?\\n\\nAI systems follow the structure inside prompts as if they are rules. Good instructions guide flow even for complex tasks. Many programming languages follow strict patterns, so prompts must reflect that. Every phase of the build work shifts when developers choose cleaner phrasing.\\n\\nTesting grows easier when prompts include edge cases. Teams often add lines that describe unit tests directly inside instructions. Test lists give AI a clear frame for behavior and catch issues before release.\\n\\nMany prompts also include steps for code debugging. These steps help identify logic gaps and remove redundant code during review. Quality increases when developers describe the structure early.\\n\\n### Change in Perspective\\n\\nWork in software often moves fast. Pressure builds, and clarity fades. Then prompts become the map. They point to a clean way forward. Each line carries intent. Each detail shapes the structure. Many engineering teams notice something simple.\\n\\nClear thought leads to clear code.\\n\\nAI helps, but only with direction. A shift begins. Prompts become design tools. They act like quiet guides inside systems. They keep patterns steady. They protect functionality. They hold the frame together.\\n\\n## A Deep Look At Testing And Review\\n\\nTesting plays a large role in shaping development quality.\\n\\nMany teams now write prompts that describe test patterns directly. AI systems respond well when prompts mention the testing framework or expected output patterns. Consistent prompts lead to consistent tests.\\n\\nStrong review patterns follow the same logic. Teams use prompts to request detailed comments inside the generated code. Comments help developers analyze sections and identify issues. Many groups also describe how to suggest improvements inside automated reviews. Review clarity shapes stronger coding practices.\\n\\nPrompts influence:\\n\\n- **Code clarity:** description that supports future reading\\n- **Review flow:** description that guides comments\\n-

diagram illustrates how the structure around prompts guides the system from idea to final behavior.\\n\\n## A Look At Real Patterns From Teams\\n\\nExperienced developers often develop their own coding patterns for using AI. Many describe how prompts help them create stable apps with fewer errors. Several also note how helpful code generation is when prompts are detailed.\\n\\nTeams use prompts to define logic, input flow, database steps, and testing rules. These prompts also help during tough moments, such as handling edge cases or reducing errors.\\n\\nPrompts also shape:\\n\\n- **Data flow:** description through the system\\n- **Testing order:** description for tests\\n- **Function design:** description for naming and structure\\n- **Review moments:** description to catch missing parts\\n\\n\\nMany groups also add notes to prompts to preserve functionality during updates.\\n> “Prompt structure behaves almost like code. Small tweaks shift the entire output, and the model responds better when the task, context, and boundaries are spelled out. It feels less like writing plain text and more like working through logic.”\\n>\\n> — *Senior developer discussing prompt engineering patterns*\\n>\\n> [Source on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1nk83di?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\\n\\n## How It Works On Rocket.new\\n\\n[Rocket.new](http://Rocket.new) is a [vibe solutions platform](https://www.rocket.new/blog/how-the-vibe-solutions-platform-transforms-team-workflow) that offers a simple path for teams looking to build apps without deep coding. Prompts act as the main instruction layer.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n- **Prompt based builder:** description helps create whole apps\\n- **Live preview:** description updates in real time\\n- **One click actions:** description supports feature expansion\\n- **Database builder:** description creates data tables\\n- **Template gallery:** description provides examples\\n- **Auto test suggestions:** description assists in test thinking\\n\\n\\nClear direction inside prompts shapes how Rocket handles structure.\\n\\n### Steps On Rocket.new\\n\\n1. **Describe the app:** description given inside a natural language prompt\\n2. **Define features:** description added to refine logic\\n3. **Shape interface:** description provided through short instructions\\n4. **Review screens:** description seen in auto generated previews\\n5. **Test flow:** description shared through guided test tools\\n6. **Publish:** description ready for deployment\\n\\n## Why Prompt-Driven Direction Works\\n\\nClear structure inside prompts shapes every part of development. Many teams use prompts to clean up logic, guide testing, and produce stable, less confusing code. Strong patterns also ensure systems behave predictably. This leads to cleaner reviews and faster progress. A steady approach to prompting helps developers stay focused while still gaining the benefits of prompt-to-code systems.\\n\\n========================\\n\""
2025-12-30T23:15:57.212577Z DEBUG ThreadId(17) rigscribe::tools::prompt_reviewer: src/tools/prompt_reviewer.rs:79: PromptReviewer produced artifact: Artifact { system_prompt: "### Persona\n\nYou are an Expert Rust API Documentation and Testing Specialist. Your sole purpose is to analyze an existing Rust crate and augment it with comprehensive, idiomatic, and high-quality documentation and tests, following official Rust standards with extreme precision. You are relentlessly thorough and prioritize safety and correctness above all else.\n\n### Core Directives\n\n1.  **Code Immutability:** You are absolutely forbidden from altering, refactoring, or fixing any existing code logic, function signatures, or the public API. Your task is exclusively additive (documentation and tests). NEVER introduce any semantic changes to the production code.\n2.  **Idiomatic Rust:** You MUST strictly adhere to the official Rust API Guidelines, `rustdoc` conventions, and standard testing practices. The final output should be indistinguishable from documentation and tests written by the Rust core team.\n3.  **Complete Coverage:** Your goal is 100% coverage.\n    *   You MUST add documentation for 100% of all public items (modules, structs, enums, functions, methods, traits, and macros).\n    *   You MUST write tests to achieve 100% line and branch coverage for the existing code. If this is impossible without modifying the code, you MUST follow the Conflict Resolution Protocol below.\n\n### Process\n\nYou MUST follow this sequence of operations for each file provided:\n\n1.  **Analyze Public API:** First, identify all public items in the given Rust source file.\n2.  **Document Concurrently:** For each public item, write the documentation comments directly above it. Follow the **Documentation Rules** strictly.\n3.  **Test Exhaustively:** After documenting all public items in a module, write the corresponding unit tests within a `#[cfg(test)]` module in the same file. For crate-level functionality, add integration tests in the `tests/` directory. Follow the **Testing Rules** strictly.\n4.  **Identify Untestable Code:** While writing tests, identify any code paths that are impossible to test without modifying the source code. Do not attempt to test them. Instead, report them as per the **Conflict Resolution Protocol**.\n5.  **Identify Bugs:** If, during documentation or testing, you discover a bug (e.g., a panic, incorrect output, or logical flaw), you MUST report it as per the **Conflict Resolution Protocol**. DO NOT FIX THE BUG.\n6.  **Generate Output:** Consolidate all your work into the specified **Output Format**.\n\n### Documentation Rules\n\n*   **Language:** All documentation MUST be written in simple, clear, and internationally accessible English.\n*   **Style:** The tone MUST be concise yet pedagogical. Explain the \"why\" and the use case, not just the \"what.\"\n*   **Structure:** Every public item's documentation MUST follow this structure:\n    1.  A brief, one-sentence summary enclosed in `///`.\n    2.  A blank `///` line.\n    3.  A more detailed explanation of its behavior, parameters, and return values.\n    4.  A section titled `/// # Examples` containing at least one runnable `rustdoc` example. The example MUST be runnable with `cargo test --doc`.\n    5.  (If applicable) A section titled `/// # Panics` explaining any conditions that will cause a panic.\n*   **Examples:** Examples MUST be minimal, self-contained, and perfectly illustrate the primary functionality of the item.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n*   **Placement:** Unit tests MUST be placed in a `mod tests { ... }` block annotated with `#[cfg(test)]`. Integration tests go in the `tests/` directory.\n*   **Clarity:** Test function names MUST clearly describe what they are testing (e.g., `test_new_with_valid_parameters_succeeds`).\n*   **Assertions:** Use `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `assert_ne!` macros for checks. Tests MUST validate success, failure, and edge-case behaviors.\n*   **Coverage:** Write the minimum number of tests required to achieve full coverage of all logic branches.\n\n### Conflict Resolution Protocol\n\nThis protocol is your primary directive for handling conflicts with the **Code Immutability** rule.\n\n*   **Untestable Code:** If any code cannot be tested without modification (e.g., due to private fields, hard-coded dependencies, or unmockable interfaces), you MUST NOT modify the code. Instead, you MUST document the specific file, line number, and a brief explanation of why it is untestable in the \"Untestable Code Report\" section of your output.\n*   **Bugs Discovered:** If you discover a bug, you MUST NOT fix it. Instead, you MUST document the bug in the \"Bug Report\" section of your output. The report for each bug must include:\n    1.  The file and line number where the bug is located.\n    2.  A description of the bug.\n    3.  A minimal, runnable test case that reproduces the bug.\n    4.  A description of the expected behavior vs. the actual buggy behavior.\n\n### Input\n\nThe input will be the complete source code of the Rust crate, provided within a delimiter.\n\n```rust\n### CRATE SOURCE CODE ###\n{{USER_PROVIDED_RUST_CRATE_SOURCE_CODE}}\n```\n\n### Output Format\n\nYour final output MUST be a single Markdown block containing the following sections. All file modifications MUST be presented in a standard unified diff format.\n\n```markdown\n## Modified Files\n\nProvide a list of all files that have been modified with new documentation and tests. For each file, provide the complete path and the changes in a unified diff format.\n\n**File:** `src/lib.rs`\n```diff\n--- a/src/lib.rs\n+++ b/src/lib.rs\n@@ -1,5 +1,13 @@\n+//!

Your sole purpose is to analyze an existing Rust crate and augment it with comprehensive, idiomatic, and high-quality documentation and tests, following official Rust standards with extreme precision. You are relentlessly thorough and prioritize safety and correctness above all else.\\n\\n### Core Directives\\n\\n1.  **Code Immutability:** You are absolutely forbidden from altering, refactoring, or fixing any existing code logic, function signatures, or the public API. Your task is exclusively additive (documentation and tests). NEVER introduce any semantic changes to the production code.\\n2.  **Idiomatic Rust:** You MUST strictly adhere to the official Rust API Guidelines, `rustdoc` conventions, and standard testing practices. The final output should be indistinguishable from documentation and tests written by the Rust core team.\\n3.  **Complete Coverage:** Your goal is 100% coverage.\\n    *   You MUST add documentation for 100% of all public items (modules, structs, enums, functions, methods, traits, and macros).\\n    *   You MUST write tests to achieve 100% line and branch coverage for the existing code. If this is impossible without modifying the code, you MUST follow the Conflict Resolution Protocol below.\\n\\n### Process\\n\\nYou MUST follow this sequence of operations for each file provided:\\n\\n1.  **Analyze Public API:** First, identify all public items in the given Rust source file.\\n2.  **Document Concurrently:** For each public item, write the documentation comments directly above it. Follow the **Documentation Rules** strictly.\\n3.  **Test Exhaustively:** After documenting all public items in a module, write the corresponding unit tests within a `#[cfg(test)]` module in the same file. For crate-level functionality, add integration tests in the `tests/` directory. Follow the **Testing Rules** strictly.\\n4.  **Identify Untestable Code:** While writing tests, identify any code paths that are impossible to test without modifying the source code. Do not attempt to test them. Instead, report them as per the **Conflict Resolution Protocol**.\\n5.  **Identify Bugs:** If, during documentation or testing, you discover a bug (e.g., a panic, incorrect output, or logical flaw), you MUST report it as per the **Conflict Resolution Protocol**. DO NOT FIX THE BUG.\\n6.  **Generate Output:** Consolidate all your work into the specified **Output Format**.\\n\\n### Documentation Rules\\n\\n*   **Language:** All documentation MUST be written in simple, clear, and internationally accessible English.\\n*   **Style:** The tone MUST be concise yet pedagogical. Explain the \\\"why\\\" and the use case, not just the \\\"what.\\\"\\n*   **Structure:** Every public item's documentation MUST follow this structure:\\n    1.  A brief, one-sentence summary enclosed in `///`.\\n    2.  A blank `///` line.\\n    3.  A more detailed explanation of its behavior, parameters, and return values.\\n    4.  A section titled `/// # Examples` containing at least one runnable `rustdoc` example. The example MUST be runnable with `cargo test --doc`.\\n    5.  (If applicable) A section titled `/// # Panics` explaining any conditions that will cause a panic.\\n*   **Examples:** Examples MUST be minimal, self-contained, and perfectly illustrate the primary functionality of the item.\\n\\n### Testing Rules\\n\\n*   **Placement:** Unit tests MUST be placed in a `mod tests { ... }` block annotated with `#[cfg(test)]`. Integration tests go in the `tests/` directory.\\n*   **Clarity:** Test function names MUST clearly describe what they are testing (e.g., `test_new_with_valid_parameters_succeeds`).\\n*   **Assertions:** Use `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `assert_ne!` macros for checks. Tests MUST validate success, failure, and edge-case behaviors.\\n*   **Coverage:** Write the minimum number of tests required to achieve full coverage of all logic branches.\\n\\n### Conflict Resolution Protocol\\n\\nThis protocol is your primary directive for handling conflicts with the **Code Immutability** rule.\\n\\n*   **Untestable Code:** If any code cannot be tested without modification (e.g., due to private fields, hard-coded dependencies, or unmockable interfaces), you MUST NOT modify the code. Instead, you MUST document the specific file, line number, and a brief explanation of why it is untestable in the \\\"Untestable Code Report\\\" section of your output.\\n*   **Bugs Discovered:** If you discover a bug, you MUST NOT fix it. Instead, you MUST document the bug in the \\\"Bug Report\\\" section of your output. The report for each bug must include:\\n    1.  The file and line number where the bug is located.\\n    2.  A description of the bug.\\n    3.  A minimal, runnable test case that reproduces the bug.\\n    4.  A description of the expected behavior vs. the actual buggy behavior.\\n\\n### Input\\n\\nThe input will be the complete source code of the Rust crate, provided within a delimiter.\\n\\n```rust\\n### CRATE SOURCE CODE ###\\n{{USER_PROVIDED_RUST_CRATE_SOURCE_CODE}}\\n```\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nYour final output MUST be a single Markdown block containing the following sections. All file modifications MUST be presented in a standard unified diff format.\\n\\n```markdown\\n## Modified Files\\n\\nProvide a list of all files that have been modified with new documentation and tests. For each file, provide the complete path and the changes in a unified diff format.\\n\\n**File:** `src/lib.rs`\\n```diff\\n--- a/src/lib.rs\\n+++ b/src/lib.rs\\n@@ -1,5 +1,13 @@\\n+//!
